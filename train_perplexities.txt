inf
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	648.0294189453125
after this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	1045.1126708984375
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	3153.699951171875
he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire.	495.841064453125
had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	945.4632568359375
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	1448.5252685546875
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	871.4813842773438
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	771.5682373046875
they are not married,
     nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
     your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	536.7945556640625
[illustration: morning dress.	1559.749755859375
his appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	678.6353149414062
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."	440.48516845703125
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner's hope of lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	909.4217529296875
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	756.073486328125
and what sort of table do they keep?	719.889892578125
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	535.233642578125
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.	578.8933715820312
here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	1332.089111328125
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.	616.7908935546875
the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	622.0263671875
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together.	799.412841796875
two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	306.68597412109375
i don't know.	1913.9151611328125
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	368.8395690917969
my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal."	410.3144836425781
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	682.7985229492188
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, i am determined.	1287.8125
not that
i care about it, though.	331.2063293457031
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	880.29052734375
by you, i was properly humbled.	725.005859375
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	646.83740234375
"i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, for any thing about the entail.	450.060791015625
he really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	417.5046081542969
my aunt told me so
herself on saturday.	990.1762084960938
bingley will not be detained in london by
them."	656.3704223632812
you see on
what a footing we are.	746.7548828125
oh!	inf
two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	584.862060546875
are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	689.737548828125
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	832.8138427734375
a few days after this visit, mr. bingley called again, and alone.	411.26373291015625
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	598.9049682617188
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	767.32470703125
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	810.724609375
my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	684.2345581054688
"exceedingly well.	252.89134216308594
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	646.1974487304688
it was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	413.30987548828125
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."	606.9091186523438
with a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	734.4822998046875
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson; did not
i mention it to you?	651.74560546875
mrs. bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by
the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
meryton.	937.4366455078125
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	415.2859802246094
"it must have been his sister's doing.	517.5155639648438
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your
     attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
     demand it of your justice.	904.7318725585938
in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	986.8206787109375
if the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.	1984.8619384765625
miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	1172.859130859375
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	801.4310913085938
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	472.0117492675781
i
     take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not,
     but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.	513.217041015625
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	783.60693359375
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.	1164.7510986328125
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	589.2760620117188
"not that i _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."	476.03350830078125
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known sir william's too long.	646.4729614257812
she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	1153.42041015625
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	672.5198364257812
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	659.0377807617188
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	719.904296875
his words
seemed to imply it.	692.5731201171875
yet, indeed, i am
in earnest.	400.8521728515625
conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	637.071533203125
he heard her attentively, and then said,

"lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."	451.2213439941406
no, no,
you shall not deceive me.	379.7952880859375
it convinced her, that
accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister's being in town.	656.1720581054688
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very
pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it."	568.3257446289062
"if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	598.1558227539062
for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	687.4358520507812
the letter was to this
effect:

     "my dear lizzy,

     "i wish you joy.	465.57330322265625
what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	1115.575927734375
"i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	612.362548828125
every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	840.82421875
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london.	466.38720703125
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	309.1825866699219
"i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."	565.12158203125
she was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.	795.6145629882812
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	908.5908813476562
thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."	437.85308837890625
on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	871.7062377929688
elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	566.6021118164062
my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	377.2989196777344
his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	377.34588623046875
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	597.478759765625
she
looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	662.0706787109375
thought she.	956.7709350585938
they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	1022.0969848632812
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	420.4181213378906
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	694.3753051757812
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	506.991455078125
"my dear friend,

     "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	732.106689453125
i do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	652.0380859375
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	411.69989013671875
all were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	1130.3822021484375
but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could."	571.5521850585938
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	855.7774658203125
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	1053.044921875
regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr. wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and mrs. younge was of course removed from
     her charge.	679.7604370117188
"what is his name?"	481.5281982421875
"what do you think?	277.0704650878906
mr. collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	309.6507568359375
chapter xviii.	455.8221435546875
i have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	407.5133361816406
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	356.463623046875
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	477.4324645996094
but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	867.1203002929688
are
you going much farther?"	742.7628784179688
he was well, but so much
engaged with mr. darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	417.5772705078125
do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any project gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9.	2324.440185546875
no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	620.785400390625
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	449.8337707519531
she replied in the affirmative.	635.1893920898438
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."	684.9964599609375
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."	771.4254760742188
she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr.
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr. darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	1166.084228515625
chapter xii.	258.2942810058594

purses.	8081.05908203125
"a man who had felt less, might."	469.6463317871094
if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight.	625.3294677734375
send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.	749.9979248046875
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	897.1284790039062
"and so was i."	162.55142211914062
"la!"	427.8128356933594

one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation

"oh!	376.5555419921875
jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	598.8681640625
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	796.2658081054688
and to see dear wickham too!	473.5639343261719
darcy."	58.02021408081055
"i do not know.	349.7325439453125
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	552.28857421875
any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far."	595.6346435546875
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	318.95709228515625
"what will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!	545.0900268554688
forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."	578.0776977539062
your's, &c.

     "edw.	1917.836181640625
colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	546.5660400390625
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	286.2467346191406
you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	416.3005065917969
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	662.2313842773438
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars.	461.1794128417969
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	1344.972412109375
she answered him with cold civility.	1053.368896484375
elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord,
how tired i am!"	1037.4974365234375
could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	726.9766845703125
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	937.0103149414062
to mr. bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	895.4459228515625
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	573.6280517578125
her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr. darcy then
was.	826.5298461914062
you are not going to be _missish_, i
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	848.1566162109375
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	473.3866882324219
your sister i also watched.--her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have
     been in an error.	802.7283935546875
i am prodigiously proud of him.	1100.873291015625
had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	1236.55224609375
in that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	737.5264892578125
she then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,

"come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	638.3998413085938
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	851.5026245117188
when is your turn to come?	680.921875
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	996.1285400390625
had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	802.7957763671875
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	1184.673828125
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	1491.7239990234375
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	1025.3309326171875
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	1234.6710205078125
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	660.619384765625
he did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september, than any body else in the country.	551.736328125
she had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	336.65460205078125
"i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	680.4443969726562
chapter xv.	1155.2379150390625
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	1197.9521484375
to the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr. bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	715.6953735351562
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	699.8303833007812
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	275.1444396972656
they are gone off together
from brighton.	981.9891357421875
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	448.09478759765625
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	879.6627807617188
"i do not pretend to
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	904.1854858398438
"to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."	751.7853393554688
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	1187.5703125
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	730.51416015625
your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.	814.5406494140625
there was one part
especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the
power of reading again.	564.9801025390625
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	2954.043212890625
she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	854.6103515625
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"	545.0656127929688
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	890.1236572265625
interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	629.5470581054688
mr. denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr. wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	617.63525390625
"and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	509.3367919921875
oh, no."	77.2361068725586
"my dear, you flatter me.	677.8236083984375
she was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	1418.61083984375
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	421.9742431640625
she asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then
observed,

"your father's estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think.	552.7459716796875
i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	809.4622192382812
if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	898.5095825195312
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	706.2352905273438
"oh!	376.5555419921875
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	646.47607421875
--she could have added, "a young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner!"	591.4828491210938
she knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	760.7545166015625
lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	1056.458984375
perhaps he thought her too young.	346.44000244140625
"my dear, dear lydia!"	396.381103515625
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	716.8829345703125
it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	1222.511474609375
mrs. bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	634.9913330078125
it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."	765.9742431640625
kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	576.1697998046875
"well, well, and so mr. bingley is coming down, sister," (for mrs.
philips first brought her the news.)	376.7080078125
if elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	661.7711181640625
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."	526.6166381835938
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	563.5406494140625
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr. bingley to _her_."	419.0253601074219
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	592.9937133789062
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better.	619.9443969726562
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	1140.3028564453125
anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	727.5415649414062
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr. darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent.	578.4548950195312
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	821.5466918945312
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	736.0460205078125
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	762.9378051757812
it only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	1048.2745361328125
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	1074.6114501953125
the visit
was returned in due form.	895.8148803710938
she was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	1759.209716796875
they must be a great loss to _your_ family."	564.37939453125
"indeed i had.	312.28717041015625
if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	453.006591796875
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl's younger son?	867.6497192382812
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	367.1142272949219
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	389.7782897949219
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	712.3671875
we had better not mention it.	585.8512573242188
what are men
to rocks and mountains?	1338.502197265625
she
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	1000.8912353515625
miss bingley said something of his never
     returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.	529.787841796875
upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	1017.7573852539062
resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i
trust i am resigned.	982.77001953125
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	493.2386169433594
elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure.	757.7437744140625
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	550.217529296875
"oh, yes!--if one could but go to brighton!	685.45849609375
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	671.693359375
miss bingley was
engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	689.6171875
he had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.	726.0745849609375
but vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	666.7354125976562
do not let us
quarrel about the past.	1015.83837890625
the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr. darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	933.2882690429688
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	707.9578857421875
"probably not;--but mr. darcy can please where he chuses.	604.748291015625
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	539.548583984375
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	1019.4933471679688
i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	1595.072265625

miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	1007.0289306640625
mr. bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	1014.058837890625
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."	416.56756591796875
elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	506.4850158691406
"and i certainly _never_ shall give it.	933.169921875
who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	612.1246337890625
for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	953.370361328125
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "_i_ can
hardly be just to him."	452.549560546875
my feelings in every respect
forbid it.	1080.086669921875
the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	756.5718994140625
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	1124.286376953125
thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women.	850.33447265625
she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs. collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	818.718505859375
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was."	424.5046081542969

that _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	635.3072509765625
though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	794.4207763671875

ordinary style?	1793.3341064453125

"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be angry."	244.18397521972656
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	704.4396362304688
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!	505.7332458496094
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets.	507.889892578125

in another minute mr. bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	875.5567016601562
she resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	528.809326171875

"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	593.9085693359375
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	700.6634521484375
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long," said miss lucas, "but i
wish he had danced with eliza."	392.215087890625
her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	688.58740234375
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is
impossible.	706.9796142578125

they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet's civilities.	1279.6473388671875
their reception from mr. bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	445.39385986328125
"mrs. collins, you must send a servant with them.	417.873046875
"yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be.	415.5389404296875
he
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	734.6724853515625
he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; charlotte tried to console her.	570.4407348632812
he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	543.7383422851562
elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	742.7579345703125
he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	548.2371215820312
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	615.676025390625
nobody wants him to come.	255.09596252441406

"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	430.690673828125
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is
about."	346.60675048828125
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	691.3707885742188

he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	514.2225952148438
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	631.865234375
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity.	1570.64404296875

did before him?"	545.3684692382812

_i_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	527.6044311523438
there was no arguing upon such a project.	1138.30908203125
miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	617.4638671875

mr. gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	667.78125

collins."	53.41938781738281
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	796.8507690429688
the insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would
i give to hear your strictures on them!"	710.52880859375
i do not know the
particulars, but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	452.4261169433594
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	717.637451171875
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	652.8967895507812
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."	660.3114013671875
when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	702.2432250976562
but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	360.16796875
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	885.4847412109375
"ah!	175.0257568359375
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

     the use of project gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.	1905.785400390625
the reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	1518.383056640625
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect.	670.6215209960938
had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	604.6306762695312
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	1260.9080810546875
bingley urged mr. jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	1231.93115234375
she was gone directly.	1647.9873046875
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	571.0122680664062
my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	931.7039794921875
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	755.9202880859375
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	913.8091430664062
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	739.562744140625
the others have been gone on to scarborough,
these three weeks."	664.167724609375
the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	803.5521240234375
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	1355.2845458984375
letters of business too!	631.07421875
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	1222.6251220703125
at present i will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	620.1762084960938

were questions with which she amused herself.	418.9488525390625
have you seen any pleasant men?	1235.9833984375
he was received by mrs.
bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	861.758056640625
"i think she will.	432.2755126953125
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	285.5201416015625
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding, than i now do of her heart.	626.7817993164062
and what sort of young lady is she?	593.9151000976562
the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	548.85986328125
after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr. collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner, though unknown.	589.8897705078125
balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	1090.721435546875
"it must not be thought of.	401.6490783691406
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.	520.3433837890625
she was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."	1042.21337890625
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming.	570.4010620117188
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	1307.107421875
they came.	226.4447784423828
"oh!	376.5555419921875
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	694.037353515625
we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	487.5731201171875
the business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	539.2237548828125
but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"	583.1288452148438
the reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as i have given above.	504.82275390625
she remembered also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr.
darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	699.150634765625
what am i to do?"	477.5920715332031
he did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	424.9678039550781
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	734.47705078125
i promised
them so faithfully!	729.4354248046875
but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	659.6420288085938
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.	1565.0772705078125
"your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	867.7932739257812
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said mr. bennet, as he folded up the letter.	536.7203369140625
his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	626.6870727539062
they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."	467.78033447265625
she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	791.9732666015625
lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	656.5617065429688
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	757.560302734375
"impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	477.3491516113281
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	545.69287109375
pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	667.4189453125
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	742.4197387695312
poor dear
child!	2185.649169921875
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	889.5427856445312
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	1092.63232421875
i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	922.0624389648438
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	803.64599609375
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	533.2959594726562
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	1101.42041015625
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	505.46661376953125
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	569.9290771484375
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	595.1505737304688
i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	1601.512939453125
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs. gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	916.9373779296875
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	1158.89306640625
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	396.0718078613281
mrs. hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	722.6312866210938
oh!	inf
you will hardly bear to be
long outdone by jane.	1116.8773193359375
she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	1235.7606201171875
my dear jane, mr. collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	502.7182312011719
only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	569.7179565429688
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	436.6885681152344
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	502.14227294921875
in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr. darcy were by no means over.	723.0045776367188
allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."	692.6966552734375
mrs. bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	380.719482421875
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."	284.6862487792969
the death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	446.6337585449219
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	1775.0960693359375
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	417.5935974121094
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	788.2881469726562
she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	824.8553466796875
good bye.	634.5936279296875
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled.	678.0728149414062
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	637.0861206054688
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	724.1030883789062
all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	527.60791015625
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	968.22265625
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	627.345458984375
does she live near you, sir?"	864.0499267578125
as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	1068.367919921875
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	538.1793212890625
well, how pleased i am!	765.207275390625
his countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	686.3193359375
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	641.726318359375
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	485.98822021484375
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!	672.5923461914062
if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	677.4371337890625
cried elizabeth.	338.4321594238281
towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards myself."	621.1575927734375
chapter vii.	352.73797607421875
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	621.20263671875
she comes to us to-day.	917.0405883789062
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	402.080810546875
sir william had been
delighted with him.	641.2732543945312
instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	558.3143310546875
it was to be such a secret!"	520.1481323242188
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr. philips's.	677.3453979492188
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	681.5159912109375
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	1209.460205078125
i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	587.0501098632812
the former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	994.9256591796875
"you mistake me, my dear.	741.5341796875
and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	803.5249633789062
she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	475.8984680175781
for forty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	1565.0765380859375
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone."	870.1443481445312
many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	705.516357421875
i am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	422.74420166015625
he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	516.4597778320312
my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	753.002685546875
"yes, indeed," cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	596.6471557617188
they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	551.88525390625
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	1289.0289306640625
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr. bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	404.6041564941406
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	523.5020751953125
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	678.13623046875
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said
elizabeth.	547.4993286132812
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	1481.8695068359375
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	501.5079345703125
but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	393.97235107421875
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	725.6107177734375
it was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	2075.995361328125
"_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."	501.51702880859375
they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	1754.3360595703125
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."	546.7933349609375
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	1132.6180419921875
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	680.698486328125
"all!--what, all five out at once?	535.244140625
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	974.037841796875
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.	3085.37841796875
i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, i am thus rejected.	801.6585083007812
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	717.56005859375
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would
     write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	413.92303466796875
from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	950.5206298828125
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	596.8238525390625
her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."	700.26904296875
and there was my
aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	773.9334716796875
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	910.4487915039062
it was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	388.0625
while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	537.3328857421875
i shall be back by dinner."	504.0564270019531
there was no want of discourse.	613.2979736328125
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs.
bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly."	460.12353515625
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant.	537.6058349609375
how he must have felt it!"	382.90203857421875
it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	943.814208984375
lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	446.7845764160156
my excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.	786.801025390625
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."	542.8075561523438
at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs. reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	447.8961181640625
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs.
bennet instantly answered,

"oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am
sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	619.356689453125
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family.	573.003662109375
they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	1091.989013671875
her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	636.21337890625
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	387.4613952636719
you shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	988.372802734375
"there
is nothing the matter with me.	504.5094299316406
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	633.2518310546875
is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	902.686279296875
"and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	1194.038330078125
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley."	436.801025390625
who could have done less for her?	488.96051025390625
mrs. long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	857.4002075195312
"very much."	317.4984130859375
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	1880.34912109375
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."	410.8703308105469
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	548.055419921875
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy.	768.057861328125
his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	1336.4339599609375
mrs. bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr. bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	646.5411376953125
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam.	1138.4056396484375
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	863.609130859375
she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	465.6974182128906
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	509.559326171875
elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	523.7122802734375
his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	951.7129516601562
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!	441.5380859375
two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	901.5059814453125
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	175.4972686767578
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."	844.8350830078125
after a short pause,
her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	685.0154418945312
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	575.0639038085938
"_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr.
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	505.2046813964844
when
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	501.8377990722656
and gravely glancing
at mr. darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i
shall keep mine to swell my song."	1067.0040283203125
generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself.	543.3200073242188
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	675.7320556640625
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	570.7724609375
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	959.7391967773438
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	882.0022583007812
after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	911.2314453125
"good gracious!"	1372.493408203125
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir
william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	629.77978515625
can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	1215.875244140625
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did.	439.8559265136719
on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	770.4686279296875
mrs. collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr. collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	598.9312744140625
painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	490.48748779296875
but, lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	390.051025390625
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	305.49237060546875
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	710.7860107421875
i ought not to have said a word about it.	322.8149108886719
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	712.2313232421875
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."	769.2439575195312
"i should never have said mrs. collins
was settled _near_ her family."	396.4778747558594
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	735.9930419921875
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	756.249755859375
she is almost three and twenty!	942.8466796875
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	998.3858642578125
so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	1250.3697509765625
when a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."	679.482421875
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs.	1326.1058349609375
mr. collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	790.1054077148438
he
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	924.8973999023438
you know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	757.911865234375
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	668.8379516601562
his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	597.0626831054688
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	820.4513549804688
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	915.2630615234375
he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	574.2166748046875
we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	1038.9613037109375
with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."	627.7966918945312
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy,
"of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	560.5441284179688
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr.	1261.4432373046875
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	350.4202880859375
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country.	424.6094665527344
and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	1036.5084228515625
"i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	564.1275634765625
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	770.4512939453125
what will wickham say?	666.279296875
let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	435.3128967285156
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	562.32763671875
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know
that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?"	588.570068359375
unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	1030.3536376953125
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	810.0398559570312
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	504.5869140625
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	765.65185546875
every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	972.686767578125
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	489.44219970703125
my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me.	447.6469421386719
i see the imprudence
of it.--oh!	1138.6580810546875
while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	636.7110595703125
"what do you mean, hill?	1149.9765625
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought
only of _you_."	405.6196594238281
he did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	668.0535278320312
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	1642.802734375
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	357.9608154296875
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	381.71490478515625
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon.	625.8538818359375
chapter x.


the day passed much as the day before had done.	594.0388793945312
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	392.57452392578125
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	803.2364501953125
recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	532.1152954101562
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	1277.1376953125
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	1095.2890625
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	358.60662841796875
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	854.5858764648438
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	477.8939208984375
mr. wickham began the subject himself.	552.2440795898438
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	523.0943603515625
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	593.200439453125
bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	328.363037109375
my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	1370.5313720703125
"that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer."	437.252197265625
one came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	421.780517578125
but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs. bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	735.594482421875
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	1141.7996826171875
but mr. gardiner
     could not be seen, and mr. darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.	602.3802490234375
she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	581.7621459960938
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	467.76336669921875
my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!	1462.5931396484375
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs. long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."	329.96038818359375
he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	586.6141357421875
chapter viii.	605.2932739257812
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful."	627.8978881835938
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	544.355224609375
i do think mrs. long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	638.2357788085938
"not the slightest.	763.9134521484375
i cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	402.3917236328125
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	963.8975830078125
my dear hill, have you
heard the good news?	841.7677612304688
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	968.7819213867188
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	662.0438232421875
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	613.210205078125
they may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."	716.8703002929688
she could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	1524.5643310546875
the express was sent off directly.	947.9415893554688
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	1366.720703125
special rules,
set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark.	1234.2860107421875
he studies too much for
words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	541.688720703125
"oh!	376.5555419921875
i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	970.142822265625
mr. bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	573.3922729492188
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel
fitzwilliam.	551.2529907226562
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	656.331298828125
a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern.	655.2090454101562
i was very
uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	735.91015625
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	790.0274047851562
what is the matter?"	477.0201110839844
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	1832.6614990234375
there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	547.56591796875
the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	959.8980102539062
their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially,
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	711.5113525390625
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	599.1326293945312
mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs. bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	962.9663696289062
elizabeth silently attended
her.	720.54443359375
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	505.8586730957031
i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!	401.2183837890625
such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	850.8341674804688
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	1057.299072265625
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	588.0317993164062
chapter iv.	544.9842529296875
her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	616.869384765625
"so much the better.	248.4611358642578
though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	1048.156005859375
mrs. wickham!	238.7330780029297
"john told us mr. darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	539.4415893554688
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.	651.998291015625
i want to talk very seriously.	900.7454223632812
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise.	1152.2593994140625
on saturday he came again.	269.01654052734375
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	696.5597534179688
console lady catherine as well as
     you can.	356.5277099609375
he begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any
message to her.	626.8780517578125
the feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	538.1629028320312
but what does he say of the living?"	433.18096923828125
he has the
     promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the north.	858.010009765625
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	1074.9896240234375
not handsome enough to dance with!	261.7967224121094
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	404.1845397949219
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	377.40704345703125
--said jane as she
finished it.	620.37646484375
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	1271.15380859375
every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	697.5908203125
i did not think mrs.
gardiner was so little to be trusted."	436.3896484375
without a governess you must
have been neglected."	746.4775390625
many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i
despair.	596.067626953125
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	544.0775756835938
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	948.7596435546875
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	286.7803649902344
every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	2084.552978515625
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."	477.1705017089844
mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	1244.748779296875
and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."	808.225341796875
"not yet," replied jane.	365.947265625
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	952.7273559570312
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	1028.3436279296875
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	1693.94580078125
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."	522.5139770507812
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	1374.6390380859375
then turning to mr. bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	752.966064453125
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	457.636962890625
mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.	756.1538696289062
she was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	744.843017578125
mrs. gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	772.6945190429688
mr. wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family.	1257.310546875
my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	604.253662109375
in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	623.8037719726562
elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of mr. darcy.	364.762939453125
and
what do you think she said besides?	577.4346923828125
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	981.312744140625
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr. wickham and the
officers, mr. collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	671.1298828125

"your affectionate friend,

     "lydia bennet."	318.5257568359375
they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	604.0433349609375
since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	558.2799682617188
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."	645.4857177734375
now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"	903.8380126953125
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	756.0067749023438
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	624.21435546875
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	935.5031127929688
you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	506.5011901855469
the strangeness of mr. collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	722.1731567382812
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	957.0214233398438
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	911.3605346679688
if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	406.25921630859375
"she is my youngest girl but one.	823.5203247070312
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for jane.	436.9293518066406
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	400.941650390625
it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	639.8364868164062
mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	841.1490478515625
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	386.2468566894531
where, where is my uncle?"	357.18572998046875
"and then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	585.5359497070312
every body is disgusted with his pride.	1232.82080078125
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	905.1646728515625
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	677.4868774414062
he is come--mr. bingley is
come.--he is, indeed.	459.0378723144531
but it was not to be.	132.73268127441406
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	641.4093627929688
mr. bingley arrived.	1540.3509521484375
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	852.9403686523438
"oh!	376.5555419921875
tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."	689.8612060546875
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	496.4902648925781
he resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	574.5177001953125
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	548.0484008789062
where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	2781.675048828125
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	610.0330810546875
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	393.79296875
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	346.7292175292969
i have
not the smallest hope.	444.3031311035156
"i must not decide on my own performance."	719.498291015625
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise
full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	1223.3453369140625
elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	1213.1597900390625
i wish you had been there.	364.0447998046875
every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	775.3759155273438
"having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	819.7626953125
she went on.	237.77456665039062
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty.	508.0582275390625
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr. darcy," she cried; "i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	584.2296142578125
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	740.2161254882812
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	549.178466796875
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede.	1141.903076171875
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	469.40386962890625
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."	505.3487548828125
she
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	936.9776611328125
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	506.78192138671875
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	484.564453125
while in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!	640.7689208984375
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	728.0565795898438
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	1133.498779296875
you must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	431.65716552734375
i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	613.8213500976562
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	420.3962707519531
but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is.	404.13134765625
you need not.	320.3433837890625
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	544.7982177734375
with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	1322.502685546875
he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him."	548.6903076171875
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem.	715.682373046875
mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	913.44580078125
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs. philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	439.4833679199219
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before.	436.5111999511719
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	1095.3397216796875
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	975.1587524414062
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."	749.27978515625
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings.	603.7890625
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	1231.2135009765625
chapter i.


miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	459.5755615234375
section 1.  general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.a.	1164.7021484375
my dear mr. bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	465.4971618652344
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.	563.3453369140625
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great
books, and make extracts."	613.6747436523438
"which do you mean?"	417.11456298828125
nor was darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	860.6025390625
she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	1004.2395629882812
i am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	453.01739501953125
she is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will _make_ her know it."	546.5379028320312
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton.	326.5860290527344
after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	657.7412109375
her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	648.2825317382812
"if!	327.7370300292969
lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	825.9920654296875
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	543.4493408203125
it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!	617.5857543945312
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr.	488.6155700683594
i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	404.22271728515625
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	984.470703125
thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	756.1632080078125
haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.	615.8965454101562
"no; but it must be done soon."	295.181396484375
"let her be called down.	445.342041015625
by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	813.5108642578125
in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"oh!	1721.0087890625
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs.
hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	619.8385620117188
your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."	367.69061279296875
the old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who lives with them.	761.8570556640625
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	408.74835205078125
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of project gutenberg-tm works.	946.6510620117188
it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	640.1642456054688
his disposition must
be dreadful."	586.720458984375
"upon my word," said mrs. gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	356.7140808105469
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	385.999755859375
on distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	630.6416015625
you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."	556.6048583984375
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	865.4910888671875
he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases.	979.479248046875
"i am not one and twenty."	430.906982421875
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."	382.01190185546875
but
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	935.77392578125
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	426.24310302734375
i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	662.3785400390625
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	595.8453979492188
after
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	529.6009521484375
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	272.0221862792969
we were
married, you know, at st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	940.0377807617188
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	1065.455810546875
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield.	803.4230346679688
the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"are you pleased with kent?"	717.8427734375
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	804.7849731445312
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which
i have not already heard.	574.4974365234375
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable
house.	446.279296875
cried elizabeth.	338.4321594238281
"_that_ you certainly shall."	241.4799346923828
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	650.995849609375
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	685.8642578125
they were in ----
     street.	535.4197387695312
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	365.9180908203125
if i may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."	493.18829345703125
they
followed her into the dining-parlour.	440.4246826171875
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	725.775146484375
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	858.92529296875
she declared her resolution.	1083.1630859375
he
is so excessively handsome!	880.1490478515625
i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother
lady catherine.	506.9900207519531
mr.
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	929.6976318359375
he was full of joy and
attention.	959.5433349609375
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with _him_,
if i were you."	265.478271484375
she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	475.078369140625
i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	459.3144226074219
when this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	539.3047485351562
its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	1924.3336181640625
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone mr. collins began.	408.47381591796875
"oh!	376.5555419921875
the first part of mrs. gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	1257.1270751953125
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	613.9522094726562
he did trace them easily to
     clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from epsom.	1280.078125
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr. wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	875.3704833984375
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	1689.2939453125
almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	708.2672119140625
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	572.2006225585938
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	747.205810546875
but, really, i know not what to say.	246.53335571289062
mr. collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.	763.72216796875
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	722.1473388671875
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	483.01007080078125
i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner.	312.52044677734375
and who knows what _may_ happen?	4086.49560546875
"i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."	382.2688293457031
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	1228.41162109375
chapter iii.	787.6764526367188
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	674.570556640625
"dearest jane!	309.9500427246094
bennet.--they had several children.	984.3463134765625
and his
answering immediately to the last question--oh!	1118.2916259765625
_she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	865.845703125
pray do not talk of that odious man.	1440.277587890625
and if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	605.4915771484375
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	784.3692016601562
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	730.6259765625
my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	672.2223510742188
miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	607.6179809570312
what are you telling miss bennet?	863.4000244140625
people _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true.	681.19140625
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to
understand it.	485.8258056640625
his debts are to be paid,
     amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.	1048.1044921875
bingley."	69.62913513183594
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."	1154.834228515625
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	355.27288818359375
she dared not relate the other
half of mr. darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	823.8215942382812
"i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing.	556.1580810546875
said her aunt.	314.2143249511719
"with the officers!"	509.4490051269531
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be
dissuaded from it.	683.794921875
what could she mean by
it?	622.072021484375
never mind miss
lizzy's hair."	641.5592041015625
gardiner."	66.73867797851562
of course, we hope that you will support the project
gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.	975.6350708007812
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	396.8186950683594
but slyness seems the fashion.	1582.589111328125
"removed!"	412.45343017578125
not that _i_ think
charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	855.34130859375
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	540.9927978515625
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs. gardiner, "i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	480.7628173828125
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.	827.587158203125
"this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy.	416.2685546875
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	795.3679809570312
"none at all.	385.74365234375
you alluded to something else.	873.1906127929688
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you.	538.3948974609375
why was he to be the judge?"	375.43463134765625
a person may be
proud without being vain.	941.1653442382812
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	852.1931762695312
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."	484.2893371582031
but, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."	373.38348388671875
that had
his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as mr. bingley, was incomprehensible.	778.4986572265625
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	378.0291748046875
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	660.955322265625
when the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	1481.83203125
observed mrs. bennet.	375.85845947265625
most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility:

you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you."	613.5858154296875
the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr.	716.0018920898438
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	760.0811767578125
but against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	805.6692504882812
mrs. philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs. philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	676.93212890625
i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	1181.1519775390625
she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas.	361.30718994140625
"lizzy, you must not do so.	173.1512908935547
"i advise mr. darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs. bennet, "to walk
to oakham mount this morning.	355.5243835449219
my youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	542.3982543945312
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	1508.634521484375
are quite well."	118.57498931884766
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly
calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	895.3591918945312
but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	434.3966064453125
had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."	870.490478515625
"very well.	454.0072021484375
i am
afraid you will be angry."	473.192138671875
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	883.939453125
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	1226.1953125
i will only add, god bless you.	3971.676025390625
she began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	1183.76025390625
my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out.	587.202392578125
"yes, ma'am, all."	277.62738037109375
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her."	365.2015075683594
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	609.2786865234375
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of mr. darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	957.416259765625
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	618.9525146484375
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	583.7039184570312
"that is very strange.	925.7662353515625
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	457.22015380859375
this room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	816.353759765625
lord, how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty!	677.8455810546875
lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	649.6976928710938
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's
connections.	526.299560546875
does your
charge give you much trouble?	977.7093505859375
it was all conjecture."	702.9793090820312
*       *       *       *       *

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs. bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	578.3931274414062
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."	904.8104248046875
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"	808.3713989257812
darcy."	58.02021408081055
you know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	649.65771484375
how he lived i know not.	433.1985168457031
"yes, very different.	477.87933349609375
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"is not this nice?	1799.6783447265625
i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.	1080.7718505859375
but there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	1318.986572265625
and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	401.09442138671875
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	685.0092163085938
"it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	524.97265625
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	807.3294067382812
occupied in observing mr. bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	617.1150512695312
you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	570.4880981445312
was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	461.6614990234375
from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	856.083984375
nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the united states.	899.049560546875
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	682.6552734375
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr.	540.8646240234375
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	1121.5181884765625
you shall hear what she says."	582.2766723632812
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	674.1007690429688
that he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	566.4297485351562
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	540.5400390625
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	824.1748046875
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	635.6438598632812
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	727.3216552734375
secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	845.0865478515625
you know i have.	469.3141174316406
he generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	1299.5335693359375
but with _me_, it is not so.	378.8690185546875
the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	1370.1478271484375
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	792.52783203125
i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	960.2738647460938
if you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	716.9591674804688
every thing being settled between _them_, mr. darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	564.5115356445312
only think!	151.390869140625
only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	1132.2784423828125
but
my dearest love, tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of,
that i may have it to-morrow."	672.4537963867188
on being made acquainted with the
present mr. darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	972.079833984375
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	1011.6358032226562
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to
say.	210.18310546875
"yes, yes, they must marry.	555.5807495117188
chapter xx.	572.2210693359375
"you shall have it in few words.	719.7813720703125
he had to be sure done much.	412.64703369140625
"we have heard only once.	405.8653564453125
people do not die of little
trifling colds.	2043.12109375
"oh!	376.5555419921875
as a clergyman, moreover, i
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	964.95849609375
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	446.6463317871094
there is a lady, it seems, a
     mrs. younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.	458.7755126953125
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about mr. wickham.	426.3489990234375
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."	484.7322082519531
the officer was the very
mr. denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	928.6683349609375
heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	900.3868408203125
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	841.2380981445312
my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy!	335.5020446777344
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	478.6693115234375
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the
head quarters.	682.5560302734375
and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	971.4561157226562
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	888.494384765625
can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?"	498.6628723144531
his
attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	1060.427978515625
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and
lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	870.9849853515625
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	884.4213256835938
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
say you to the day?	280.5282287597656
mr. collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	815.240478515625
i should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.	484.23553466796875
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	789.4734497070312
i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	350.5018310546875
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on wednesday or thursday.	481.1554260253906
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr. collins in time."	411.5870361328125
every body said how well
she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	711.5215454101562
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	426.4303283691406
she
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	818.2017822265625
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	430.44818115234375
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	720.8458251953125
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr. bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	548.6024169921875
we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	816.2607421875
mr. what's his name.	577.1885986328125
i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	1281.80859375
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	414.57489013671875
my father and mother believe the worst,
     but i cannot think so ill of him.	314.3910217285156
till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	476.29437255859375
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	749.89208984375
he readily agreed to it.	572.0797729492188
you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	412.8345642089844
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	3438.87451171875
what a fine thing for our girls!"	909.198486328125
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	522.4918212890625
mrs. bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	934.5935668945312
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	501.58349609375
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr.	768.3304443359375
'lady
catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'	1243.858154296875
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?"	498.0279235839844
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	921.2252197265625
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_."	802.0121459960938
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"let me call your maid.	693.6297607421875
but that is not the
case _here_.	958.1954345703125
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear
     wickham, you must be very happy.	366.63226318359375
make
haste, and come down this moment."	297.9828186035156
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	561.0256958007812
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	1531.425537109375
"oh!	376.5555419921875
i could hardly keep my countenance.	1133.605712890625
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	442.5787658691406
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	973.527099609375
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know."	396.5724182128906
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	549.7197875976562
"yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	2894.119140625
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael
hart, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark.	930.8553466796875
in spite of having been at st. james's, sir william was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	862.4647216796875
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	722.9100952148438
his belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	615.01318359375
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and
i hope you will consent to be of the party.	338.4353942871094

section 5.  general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic

what do
you keep winking at me for?	788.494140625
indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."	519.3065185546875
"'tis too much!"	395.6167297363281
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!	590.8536987304688
allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	562.7200317382812
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of mr. darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	677.49267578125
how was that possible?	589.9080810546875
you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	423.4874572753906
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	821.8922729492188
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	434.86041259765625
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	240.78338623046875
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."	456.375
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.	871.321044921875
mr. bennet could not have chosen
better.	634.9962158203125
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	577.8236083984375
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come."	618.4474487304688
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	629.4396362304688
colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr. darcy they had
only seen at church.	624.8800048828125
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	2606.890380859375
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	707.38525390625
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	578.500732421875
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	1286.973388671875
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	490.90350341796875
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	602.5928344726562
by many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	676.5164794921875
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	741.33544921875
mr. jones says we must not think of moving her.	595.275146484375
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	839.2352294921875
both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	1013.4990844726562
in the former were many good paintings;
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	841.3753051757812
but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	557.1005859375
chapter viii.	605.2932739257812
that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr. bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	628.44091796875
mr. bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	560.7243041992188
"and how impossible in others!"	819.263671875
his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."	872.3407592773438
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	693.7081298828125
darcy!--and so it does i vow.	595.4548950195312
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	621.6539306640625
of having another daughter married to mr. collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	532.680419921875
"what think you of books?"	511.7256774902344
but it is so
strange!"	853.98583984375
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	626.3458862304688
mr. wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.	744.4325561523438
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	359.39764404296875
"no governess!	2324.107666015625
no,
no--i feel he may defy us there.	639.0028686523438
"is my father in town?"	443.4520568847656
as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	844.9462890625
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	1774.8929443359375
you are lucky in
having such a master."	796.2259521484375
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."	505.4345703125
is not it so, mrs.	1001.5567626953125
this mrs.
     younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	568.5667114257812
she had a sister married to a mr. philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.	592.9425659179688
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	716.81494140625
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	678.3583984375
you must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     project gutenberg-tm works.	1336.2855224609375
their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	820.971435546875
it is a nice long walk, and mr. darcy has
never seen the view."	454.26617431640625
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's
way."	322.92913818359375
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs.
gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	471.96807861328125
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	584.951904296875
the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	975.5061645507812
i am most seriously displeased."	919.1655883789062
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	386.3868713378906
but will they make you happy?"	526.3447265625
her ladyship was highly incensed.	1713.6610107421875
oh, sister!	128.20101928710938
what do i not
owe you!	582.7496948242188
"my dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	574.5820922851562
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr. collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr. bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr. collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	658.7794799804688
why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	846.153076171875
arguments are too much like disputes.	745.76416015625
"oh!	376.5555419921875
i am so happy.	710.8053588867188
"it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	361.5517578125
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	1570.174560546875
nothing could be more delightful!	1038.1759033203125
i told my sister philips so the other day.	517.6133422851562
two days after mr. bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	543.2718505859375
is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	498.7358703613281
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."	351.093994140625
"a place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	487.2925720214844
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	631.2216796875
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	668.2803955078125
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	353.9219055175781
he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	1074.6201171875
"perhaps i do.	317.99658203125
their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	1034.80908203125
mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	648.7850341796875
"a little."	181.1350860595703
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	850.7250366210938
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	1364.0091552734375
there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."	800.510986328125
it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who, when i am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	506.92449951171875
she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley.	1245.3067626953125
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	429.9236755371094
at length, she spoke again.	394.0125427246094
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."	775.013671875
well, i was so frightened i did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	344.4078063964844
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	705.8037109375
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	584.4402465820312
you have delighted us long enough.	869.6975708007812
mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had
never been a favourite with them, mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	902.7470092773438
mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, mr. darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	664.9815063476562
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
     that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.	552.4171142578125
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr. darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	823.7477416992188
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	312.7615051269531
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."	332.08782958984375
and so did mrs.
forster.	495.2274169921875
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	542.9129028320312
a flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	1353.83447265625
at such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	416.14886474609375
"you are uniformly charming!"	1694.4305419921875
at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	749.963623046875
her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	979.9525146484375
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!	415.20538330078125
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr. bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	430.1207275390625
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	548.753662109375
she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	924.9520874023438
there are a lot of things you can do with project
gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg-tm electronic
works.	828.6580810546875
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	707.1009521484375
their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	572.8643188476562
and what can _he_ have to say?"	544.5198364257812

1.e.2.	1031.07958984375
do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."	1021.6160888671875
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	1571.76416015625
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."	1150.07080078125
did he know of
their intending to go off?	915.3905029296875
"who do you mean, my dear?	500.29339599609375
family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	462.4026184082031
"oh!	376.5555419921875
"the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	835.5744018554688
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by wickham.	624.0929565429688
my dear mr. bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	360.2052307128906
and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	660.7290649414062
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	1085.5804443359375
and with a bow to mr. darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many
stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	806.271484375
i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his
regimentals."	743.8499145507812
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	839.19921875
the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	806.8606567382812
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects.	1160.0845947265625
i did not know before, that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	547.4677734375
"and you saw him frequently?"	598.8792724609375
but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years.	698.58447265625
your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."	739.1798095703125
the
gentlemen did approach; and when mr. wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	782.2857055664062
they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	1109.8636474609375
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said,

"i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	576.0087890625
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	540.5438842773438
pray, how _violent was_ mr. bingley's
love?"	1243.8770751953125
at present we
have nothing to guide us.	798.6881103515625
his sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	1003.8082275390625
but he is an ugly fellow!	1495.5556640625
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."	340.6965637207031
well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."	545.700439453125
my mind was more
agreeably engaged.	1130.4544677734375
"implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	1806.489501953125
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which i have never acknowledged.	825.6777954101562
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	413.4847106933594
it would be dreadful!	1044.97314453125
mr. bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at netherfield house.	773.8648681640625
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	670.5326538085938
chapter v.


every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	651.788818359375
"she is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	597.4935913085938
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	952.21142578125
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"	453.545654296875
your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	1095.7210693359375
you must contrive to send
somebody.	3100.09033203125
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"	1227.6807861328125
this was invitation enough.	945.906982421875
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town."	495.0739440917969
there is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.	681.4542236328125
chapter xiv.	902.8795776367188
"i am sick of mr. bingley," cried his wife.	467.85772705078125
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	557.36865234375
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"	913.710205078125
lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good humoured as lydia.	515.614013671875
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr.
wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	633.7245483398438
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance.	795.8763427734375
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.	816.267333984375
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	1145.3909912109375
the lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	546.62939453125
by nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at st. james's had made him
courteous.	2837.404296875
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	1146.6610107421875
on both sides it was only assertion.	1502.7120361328125
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	660.1659545898438
mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	974.8193969726562
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	820.4384155273438
their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	792.4024047851562
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs.
philips's manners and politeness.	928.0636596679688
she respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	605.18994140625
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	836.45654296875
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	952.4288940429688
mr. wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	414.9645080566406
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	504.7806396484375
he replied, and was again silent.	136.60568237304688
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?"	477.325927734375
it soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	684.0848388671875
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	489.5827331542969
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	490.4975280761719
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	1221.9508056640625
it was as
follows:

     "my dear sir,

     "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from hertfordshire.	751.301513671875
charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say.	584.433837890625
darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	777.59228515625
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	638.697021484375
cried elizabeth when she had
finished it.	543.15576171875
lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.	1398.960205078125
"mrs. annesley is with her.	714.58984375
he
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	549.701416015625
"we are not in a way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	441.02447509765625
"true," said mr. bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."	354.51727294921875
my brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	787.4271240234375
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	925.0376586914062
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	577.1495361328125
"beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	631.4998779296875
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	267.2810363769531
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	480.8008728027344
"sure he
will not leave london before he has found them.	545.716552734375
"of what are you talking?"	525.3600463867188
well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	574.0726928710938
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	852.2220458984375
it is just as he chooses.	1085.34228515625
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	820.9847412109375
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.	383.84149169921875
cried he, turning towards her.	1658.7772216796875
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	339.96533203125
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	632.6629638671875
"where is your sister?"	556.74365234375
"no, my dear; i think not.	320.13861083984375
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	446.78692626953125
the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	1065.1572265625
their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	887.3195190429688
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	518.6262817382812
is not he a charming man?	682.1089477539062
with a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	690.786865234375
they repulsed
every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	642.2127075195312
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	367.15643310546875
they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	661.51025390625
see
paragraph 1.c below.	3693.218017578125
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	630.9276733398438
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	611.9705200195312
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	954.4588623046875
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time.	418.23126220703125
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline.	768.52392578125
widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she
deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	709.997802734375
the more i see
of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	636.3256225585938
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	596.0025634765625
"when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	1782.427734375
and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."	604.0747680664062
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	639.076904296875
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	705.0966186523438
they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	619.9183959960938
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	1427.8309326171875
he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.	362.0144348144531
well, much good may it do them!	532.7660522460938
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.	1664.3280029296875
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.	946.0711669921875
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	876.040283203125
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	477.29132080078125
teaze him--laugh at
him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	492.1647033691406
all
elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	710.933837890625
the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	852.99609375
jane looked at her doubtingly.	1225.2227783203125
we now come to the point.	473.07440185546875
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	1238.3779296875
i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."	564.337158203125
but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	860.5914306640625
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,"
said mrs. bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	391.71942138671875
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	577.1911010742188
on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	737.568359375
_hunsford, near westerham, kent,

     15th october._

     dear sir,

     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"there, mrs.	1293.2943115234375
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr.	650.6333618164062
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	683.672607421875
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	440.0747375488281
_we_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."	355.8306884765625
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all."	724.62744140625
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	633.70849609375
but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	1003.9063110351562
_too
much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	578.2161254882812
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	722.4521484375
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	615.5609741210938
but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."	400.3310852050781
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	572.333251953125
i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham's character."	619.8876342773438
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	1054.0361328125
my sisters may write to _me_.	756.6866455078125
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	404.7405700683594
i had not
believed it possible."	358.9147033691406
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	525.9019775390625
and then when we came away it was such fun!	722.9521484375
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."	532.2457275390625
chapter ii.	728.00244140625
you have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."	664.4151000976562
this
however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	530.695556640625
you must send john with
the young ladies, mrs. collins.	800.3526000976562
girls, can i do any
thing for you in meryton?	345.38800048828125
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."	727.6980590820312
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	1470.732177734375
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	910.7566528320312
thank heaven!	165.3951416015625
these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	1245.91552734375
she was
sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	757.8247680664062
"i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	1012.9545288085938
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	879.9489135742188
in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	870.3900146484375
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	878.3856201171875
i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	1216.9993896484375
there was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	590.8092041015625
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	409.203125
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to rosings.	503.8833923339844
it is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	572.4639892578125
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	1330.8441162109375
said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	3258.9365234375
mr. darcy!	393.3982849121094
their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	1019.7772827148438
"i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."	864.135986328125
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	618.3109130859375
and one of my
own daughters.	575.1549682617188
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs. bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	418.10943603515625
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do."	440.2369689941406
but mr. gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	519.6270751953125
i know it to be impossible."	280.1202697753906
nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	451.58319091796875
she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	568.7774047851562
"what is it you mean?"	448.9832458496094
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	539.6278686523438
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	574.2254638671875
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	814.8933715820312
four nieces
of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	541.4498901367188
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	922.232177734375
mrs. bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."	596.2620849609375
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	931.2811279296875
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	526.9110107421875
she cried.	246.044921875
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	691.607177734375
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	756.3648681640625
after making
     every possible enquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into
     hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	993.1296997070312
we do not suffer by _accident_.	1548.125244140625
these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	704.4761962890625
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	766.803466796875
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	1044.0069580078125
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."	674.7271728515625
must it be so?"	351.7148132324219
they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	1077.7529296875
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	745.8751220703125
he danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	794.482177734375
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."	786.4349975585938
they can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."	324.03277587890625
but, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	457.3509826660156
i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	664.67431640625
not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	880.6129150390625
"gracechurch-street, sept. 6.	17202.310546875
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."	685.9522094726562
at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	618.9017944335938
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	418.09051513671875
has she any family?"	526.5985717773438
elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	553.150390625
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	700.49609375
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	445.22015380859375
but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	659.7867431640625
he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."	315.9636535644531
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	671.693359375
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	1235.323486328125
and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose?	792.1217041015625
you
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr. wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.	750.2730102539062
"i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	556.1490478515625
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	369.43890380859375
you will be a very happy woman."	360.3734130859375
mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr. denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	583.669921875
her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	804.6353149414062
elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	832.6649169921875
"oh!"	832.247314453125
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	687.278564453125
this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	781.7860107421875
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	594.1159057617188
he had never had the
slightest suspicion.	1176.946044921875
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	418.78387451171875
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am
_not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	620.4459838867188
"yes.	150.64059448242188
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	598.6240234375
you supposed more than
     really existed.	1265.927001953125
young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	1025.0802001953125
"la!	188.83657836914062
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and
the children.	710.284912109375
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	625.9091186523438
elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	1208.694580078125
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	1057.098388671875
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	499.1946105957031
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	627.1704711914062
"your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr.	728.5427856445312
i will read it to you--

"when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	581.0103149414062
your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	2187.552978515625
"indeed i could not.	195.14459228515625
i am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	576.2508544921875
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	476.076416015625
"i am not now to learn," replied mr. collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	703.3880615234375
amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	768.8193359375
mr. bennet protested against any
description of finery.	2305.539794921875
"but upon my honour i do _not_.	938.93310546875
it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."	880.8519287109375
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	720.64306640625
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	684.2792358398438
he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	693.9708251953125
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	474.2839050292969
did you see it?"	519.19140625
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	1063.0828857421875
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	549.2374267578125
but on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	455.88128662109375
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	684.7731323242188
he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	774.8580932617188
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	1135.4375
it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	957.711669921875
"i have just had a letter from
jane, with such dreadful news.	551.9299926757812
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	584.311279296875
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	1090.065185546875
her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	615.0170288085938
she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	894.3368530273438
"indeed!"	167.5218505859375
bingley
was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	559.5482788085938
here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	1026.2677001953125
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	554.6863403320312
about a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate;
     and thither also went mr. wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs.
     younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	776.8843994140625
so tall!--oh, my
dear lizzy!	428.68048095703125
she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	821.1010131835938
i will have no reserves from _you_."	806.1849365234375
i quite forgot!	3406.69287109375
i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	658.9937744140625
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	532.177978515625
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	512.3441162109375
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	479.63006591796875
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	638.3880004882812
"my dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	834.9390869140625
_you_
may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer."	860.6295776367188
but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	481.31561279296875
do not distress me by the idea.	566.4384155273438
and with no one to speak to, of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	483.8516845703125
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr. darcy's having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	626.0634155273438
but does not jane
correspond with the sister?	650.7373046875
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	469.096435546875
the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	804.3997802734375
mr. bennet replied that he had not.	267.77587890625

this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.	1321.107177734375
every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	757.845703125
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	860.3899536132812
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.	592.590087890625
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	587.9866333007812
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	610.2236328125
mr. darcy bowed.	3591.674072265625
good gracious!	780.1593627929688
she saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	2213.2685546875
with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"good lord!	1057.27880859375
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	626.5938720703125
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	490.9170837402344
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."	426.75152587890625
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	551.8397216796875
can it be really so!	290.0529479980469
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you
will be satisfied with what i have done.	366.2667236328125
cried elizabeth.	338.4321594238281

"good gracious!	2316.673583984375
when mrs. bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	588.2611694335938
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have
been left as printed.	2295.9140625
"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel
millar's regiment went away.	542.7501220703125
the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	743.5318603515625
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	465.20648193359375
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr. bingley," said her mother,
"i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr.
bennet's manor.	507.8237609863281
poor little lizzy!	540.177001953125
mr.
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family; jane heard them with horror.	748.6990966796875
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg:

1.e.1.	1441.4332275390625
"i am afraid, mr. darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."	635.9052124023438
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand."	540.6392822265625
till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_."	834.34130859375
"oh!	376.5555419921875
no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy.	962.159912109375
you must learn some
of my philosophy.	2343.764892578125
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	673.8809204101562
so much the man of fashion!	563.54443359375
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	734.4620361328125
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	325.6767578125
as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	2208.283447265625
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	923.3088989257812
mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	491.9798278808594
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	295.923828125
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	525.8688354492188
you will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	1007.7749633789062
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	622.34765625
mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	1499.52099609375
i cannot
     understand it.	392.7757873535156
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	295.34515380859375
she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	763.6970825195312
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	672.6885375976562
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.	721.8378295898438
mr. bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	758.4273681640625
with the kindest concern he
     came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.	937.2864990234375
as the day of his arrival drew near,

"i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	421.76483154296875
to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	675.79296875
"yes; to the last.	244.93777465820312
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	669.6810913085938
the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	815.39208984375
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	841.1875610351562
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	723.588134765625
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	1076.4278564453125
if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	583.5814208984375
"i am
sorry it went off.	784.8072509765625
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	544.6722412109375
accompanied by a violent yawn.	2390.427001953125
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	669.5903930664062
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	522.3933715820312
mr.
bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before."	678.8434448242188
it is of no consequence.	374.90045166015625
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	586.0845947265625
mr. collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	882.359375
1.e.7.	inf
the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her.	301.94146728515625
not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley.	562.0684204101562
mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	1006.453857421875
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	832.1056518554688
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	675.3010864257812
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him!	661.6912841796875
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	799.124267578125
it was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	647.1363525390625
her answer was warmly in his favour.	688.4747924804688
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	787.5123291015625
in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	762.984375
_that_ abominable mr.	530.79833984375
you have a sweet room here, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	757.1987915039062
a
little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	529.037353515625
he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	551.8286743164062
i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	523.9935302734375
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	717.84619140625
are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	769.8270263671875
very odd!--and you only the
second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your
younger sisters must be very young?"	687.9677734375
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself."	902.6058349609375
but
these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	711.4154052734375
mr. darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	550.897705078125
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	561.2119140625
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	1096.2635498046875
"yes, she did."	128.27012634277344
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	415.7662658691406
i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had."	578.7429809570312
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	499.7449951171875
we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	840.666259765625
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	1006.2484741210938
donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	3486.74853515625
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to
think."	544.7296752929688
the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	952.292236328125
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."	655.913330078125
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i
hope, though you have but a short lease."	505.8914794921875
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	1207.78662109375
that he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr. gardiner.	601.3152465820312
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	627.64404296875
i would go and see her, if i could have the
carriage."	242.34300231933594
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr. bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	747.920166015625
when mr. bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	553.5794677734375
my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	1575.5384521484375
my father bears it better.	1346.9664306640625
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	914.9017333984375
mr. collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and
lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose fordyce's sermons.	1136.783203125
wont it, kitty?"	496.1558532714844
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	788.333251953125
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.
wickham's attentions.	623.1990356445312
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!	668.8768310546875
i understand that mr. collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	547.4794921875
the tête-à-tête surprised
them.	614.2784423828125
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	603.98779296875
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	526.9165649414062
you do not know what i suffer."	431.5038757324219
at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with
great perseverance.	942.1046752929688
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	1045.8759765625
she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	570.260986328125
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	1017.6632690429688
at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."	979.7843017578125
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr.
darcy had much better finish his letter."	378.85943603515625
_my_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property.	603.77783203125
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	1474.1944580078125
i hope we
may often meet again."	398.5696105957031
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	1131.3560791015625
how well
it sounds.	1364.22705078125
those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."	725.4017944335938
he then handed her
in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	627.8257446289062
my
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of mr. wickham.	529.0211791992188
she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	887.4879150390625
as she pronounced these words, mr. darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	849.5895385742188
i
shall now know how to act.	785.08203125
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	555.2068481445312
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	708.125
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	810.9863891601562
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas."	685.5313720703125
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	1016.6500854492188
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	459.02606201171875
he has
children of his own, and may have more.	344.99591064453125
i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	868.4017944335938
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr. collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together."	503.43499755859375
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	580.8607177734375
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	811.720703125
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	672.4136962890625
the party did not supply much conversation.	994.5765380859375
besides, there was truth in his
looks."	483.98736572265625
"you are quite right.	509.9625549316406
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him."	462.5406799316406
"i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had.	334.8697509765625
lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."	526.0436401367188
he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	639.743408203125
while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	564.4520874023438
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	378.60589599609375
nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight.	900.5435791015625
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of mr. darcy, she could not
but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	853.0302734375
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	624.5603637695312
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and
mrs. collins well."	535.8521728515625
_you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	576.0541381835938
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	607.305419921875
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."	777.5908203125
have you heard from my uncle?"	522.0756225585938
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	534.7487182617188
_their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	1180.5032958984375
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."	773.3505859375
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	874.3814086914062
"no, indeed.	193.96270751953125
as to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	974.4871215820312
the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	1093.170654296875
it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."	873.4287719726562
it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	423.7779541015625
sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	628.868408203125
it was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	627.069091796875
georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	649.3560791015625
i
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	435.81842041015625
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	763.512451171875
he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	691.779052734375
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	922.8977661132812
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	530.0625610351562
risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	724.6121826171875
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	610.9532470703125
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	1090.2393798828125
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	484.63885498046875
at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	618.5618896484375
hurst."	79.59977722167969
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	540.200439453125
how i laughed!	2068.5537109375
she had very little notice from any but him.	571.1416015625
all that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the london road.	590.8418579101562
after discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	725.06982421875
what a good joke it will be!	927.5579833984375
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	316.1015319824219
"write to me very often, my dear."	312.1451416015625
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"you, who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	722.5706176757812
"lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	967.6295776367188
elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	505.2270812988281
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	733.858154296875
but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	553.7083129882812
the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.	461.44757080078125
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs.
bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	861.0097045898438
she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	521.0691528320312
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr. darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	464.756591796875
when mr.
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte.	905.8499145507812
it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	714.390869140625
darcy_, you see, is the man!	240.97186279296875
he has not an ill-natured
look.	869.3858032226562
mr. darcy danced
only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	762.210205078125
"she
looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	910.0551147460938
they agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.	881.005615234375
as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	507.6417236328125
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	1158.0523681640625
but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	792.5853271484375
she had heard nothing of
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	1234.7823486328125
there
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	526.9971923828125
the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	585.861328125
mr. robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	751.976806640625
"your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume," said miss
bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	628.5260620117188
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this
discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	988.741455078125
"did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	312.2585754394531
but at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.	767.02392578125
of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	516.2721557617188
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr. darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia.	1044.1837158203125
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	538.1629028320312
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's
visit.	558.53076171875
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	790.8841552734375
she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	1171.98974609375
1.c.	inf
but you have chosen your fault well.--i
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	1297.353515625
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	631.1825561523438
in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind."	293.47760009765625
he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james's, with very decent composure.	1089.9176025390625
this cannot be!--engaged to mr. darcy!	281.6843566894531
but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--mr.	873.857421875
i owe all that i know
of it, to another, not to you."	232.18966674804688
assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	2603.82568359375
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their
carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	821.9252319335938
"but why all this secrecy?	1098.8358154296875
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	684.93798828125
i must speak to hill, this moment."	501.1527099609375
but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	844.650634765625
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	1175.7921142578125
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham.	1029.56640625
who would
have thought it!	788.9481201171875
bingley.--but--good
lord!	794.051513671875
here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	468.83612060546875
and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	539.1525268554688
"you must not blame my aunt.	594.9735107421875
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	482.08599853515625
"and may i ask?"	680.386962890625
but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."	408.3355407714844
darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."	552.3670654296875
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,

"lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe.	461.2601318359375
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you
say that he was at rosings?"	426.9691162109375
but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	474.5909118652344
it was really a very
handsome thought.	525.816162109375
"and what is your success?"	614.6953735351562
bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	1275.434814453125
you have done all this!	330.6850891113281
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	493.54022216796875
it will not do.	320.92938232421875
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	824.357177734375
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame.	479.87689208984375
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	183.58309936523438
from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	751.98291015625
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	723.2694091796875
but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."	443.3607177734375
"certainly not; at first.	326.771728515625
mr. collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	985.3818359375
this was
very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of mr. collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	805.7560424804688
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	917.3961791992188
it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	601.7457885742188
follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without."	852.3902587890625
how thankful am i,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.	764.2977905273438
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	458.357666015625
"that is as it happens.	683.377685546875
is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very
ill."

"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	712.9462890625
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention;
the other is charlotte's marriage.	728.812744140625
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	559.0303955078125
mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	641.3579711914062
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!	1683.09326171875
it was very little less.	485.78619384765625
elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	1100.8858642578125
she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	889.863037109375
"i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage.	487.3181457519531
there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	912.0047607421875
a promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	841.3628540039062
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	1107.5665283203125
"a great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	538.7272338867188
"but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	867.8011474609375
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	565.5474853515625
his temptation is
not adequate to the risk."	943.3107299804688
they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	391.0149230957031
you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	818.659912109375
how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	756.07421875
i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	604.7857666015625
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	512.4457397460938
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	522.4965209960938
and a
special licence.	10782.3671875
she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	488.729736328125
nonsense, how can you talk so!	477.6792907714844
"my dear jane!"	456.41070556640625
collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	248.06585693359375
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	1609.60595703125
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	807.6659545898438
to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	675.7987670898438
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	598.500732421875
as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	716.5429077148438
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	768.4729614257812
but now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	752.8267211914062
why is not every body as happy?"	532.2147827148438
chapter v.


"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	538.36767578125
"they
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr. bingley and his sisters."	535.9025268554688
it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	1664.38037109375
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr. philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	714.0397338867188
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	390.186279296875
here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	683.4793701171875
but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it."	356.52752685546875
"i never heard any thing so
abominable.	875.694091796875
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do."	411.2882385253906
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:

     "my dearest lizzy,

     "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	823.205078125
_he_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	461.89093017578125
she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	757.0836181640625
at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	862.1316528320312
mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	860.4453125
in three volumes.	3989.339111328125
she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."	679.4357299804688
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	925.392822265625
now what have you to say?"	313.63623046875
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	459.1749267578125
i am ashamed of you!	622.77783203125
--it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	638.8651733398438
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	950.0734252929688
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	886.0286865234375
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."	903.932861328125
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	984.3472900390625
you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."	775.2849731445312
but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr.	527.57421875
she opened the
door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"oh, my dear eliza!	715.3289184570312
"he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	732.7619018554688
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	481.0404968261719
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	831.362060546875
they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	678.76025390625
she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."	757.5411376953125
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."	473.1504211425781
"well, and what news does it bring?	467.9708557128906
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	485.7123107910156
i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!	842.8092041015625
and tell my dear
lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	518.1755981445312
i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	750.041259765625
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	837.001220703125
i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say.	770.4564819335938
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	687.533203125
"he
only told me, what i have now told you."	306.1560363769531
your's, &c."

mr. darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins, in
reply to his last.	566.4049072265625
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	380.72857666015625
she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention.	535.7905883789062
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	913.2755126953125
--and then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	373.48638916015625
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for
mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
mr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	719.5044555664062
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	565.9346313476562
chapter xiv.	902.8795776367188
she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."	790.6043701171875
"nearly three weeks."	600.9850463867188
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	765.116455078125
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
i, nor any body, can ever forget.	445.8135070800781
"oh!	376.5555419921875
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	441.17254638671875
had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	719.3223266601562
it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	501.3321838378906
she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	519.9105834960938
his letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	1001.9852294921875
"take whatever you like, and get away."	434.9730224609375
his regiment is there; for i suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	413.35479736328125
why does she not come in?"	614.4260864257812
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	594.698974609375
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	1362.026123046875
said he; "that is rather singular."	603.1143188476562
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	987.596923828125
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	1445.13720703125
as yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	416.1151428222656
"i wish it may."	396.07330322265625
they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	878.8678588867188
their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	878.9793090820312
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	199.13375854492188
"i honour your circumspection.	1774.335205078125
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	359.0329895019531
one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	1345.1981201171875
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs. wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	569.9486083984375
i will try again.	983.445556640625
you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	1116.628662109375
at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	1056.4237060546875
he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	876.6077270507812
"oh, lord!	1120.089599609375
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	2479.55419921875
bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	653.312255859375
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	1313.8349609375
"i will not be interrupted.	641.6351318359375
jane was by no means better.	360.2931823730469
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	589.5189208984375
he
drew a chair near her.	853.466796875
she longed to see mrs. philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs. wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to mrs. hill and the two housemaids.	477.4119567871094
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	400.0122375488281
we seem to have been designed for each
other."	519.8042602539062
her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	779.7476806640625
she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	995.2710571289062
there was also a postscript to this
effect.	1295.2816162109375
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	866.6986694335938
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!	622.0109252929688
i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	989.7514038085938
he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	668.3389892578125
she finds miss pope a treasure.	1516.477294921875
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!	1478.870849609375
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"	391.02423095703125
i only hope they may have half my
good luck.	704.640869140625
on
mr. and mrs. gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	587.4407348632812
"_her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	2028.2017822265625
my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	708.7550048828125
my fingers wait your orders."	1125.4879150390625
it is every way horrible!"	1127.8914794921875
darcy!--there
is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."	1122.2322998046875
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself.	653.2459106445312
to caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit.	699.3416748046875
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	670.6787719726562

permission and without paying copyright royalties.	1398.4986572265625
"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if _i_
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	730.872314453125
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

"you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	562.9511108398438
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	792.4163818359375
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	563.8529663085938
why must their
marriage be private?	1324.186767578125
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	543.8550415039062
how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you."	660.7369384765625
mr. collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	1189.497802734375
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	701.5531005859375
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"	781.200927734375
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	380.26409912109375
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	739.6258544921875
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	812.7880859375
but
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	630.2003173828125
but it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."	390.2802429199219
but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	613.3936157226562
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	598.3223876953125
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs. bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out.	693.2197265625
"mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself?"	587.5762939453125
but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr. darcy walk into the
room.	652.635009765625
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	233.20828247070312
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	715.5728759765625
she
had ventured only one glance at darcy.	1463.486083984375
"if he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "i shall give him up for
ever."	329.0274353027344
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	483.4061584472656
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	410.25970458984375
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh
looked that way.	1079.6551513671875
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	553.9993286132812
never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	729.73046875
"yes, very well.	273.1166687011719
bingley?"	550.1007690429688
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	801.6944580078125
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	1328.0947265625
not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
returned within the stated time.	915.1024169921875
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."	271.3997497558594
my dear," continued mrs. bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	367.15185546875
she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	804.8555908203125
it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	1114.607666015625
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	1033.2554931640625
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	746.6195678710938
"dear madam," cried mrs. hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner?	687.0216674804688
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	607.9779663085938
you had much better
dance."	314.5064697265625
but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am
ever to pay him."	468.3036804199219
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	414.86102294921875
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"you look conscious.	673.6419067382812
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	1006.5051879882812
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	942.255615234375
mr.
hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	627.0999145507812
elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	704.5205688476562
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr.
darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	756.8052978515625
chapter vi.	458.93939208984375
her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."	1480.690673828125
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	1156.1185302734375
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy,
were to entertain each other.	388.5133361816406
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	889.9598388671875
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	890.4293212890625
mrs. gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	464.83770751953125
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham's being among them.	600.27392578125
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	519.2827758789062
"fitzwilliam darcy."	233.3125
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr. bennet.	404.26666259765625
"but,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	449.5918884277344
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	642.8616333007812
the note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	987.5790405273438
chapter iv.	544.9842529296875
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     william collins."	1017.23779296875
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	661.5430297851562
chapter ix.	873.39794921875
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	403.33184814453125
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	490.60467529296875
about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	2185.7783203125
but, on second thoughts,
perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."	838.8187255859375
it is almost past belief.	3323.35888671875
miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	708.0247192382812
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	327.081298828125
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	501.454833984375
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	738.9508056640625
what congratulations will
then flow in!	1505.13525390625
that such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."	906.51318359375
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of _them_.	415.91717529296875
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	598.3848876953125
her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."	481.1022033691406
but amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following,
     as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly
     went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.	802.07373046875
when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	835.8848266601562
your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you.	551.9078979492188
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	649.3653564453125
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	839.0955810546875
mr. collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	919.65966796875
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last on mrs. bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"oh!	596.3232421875
she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	1098.837890625
"i hope, my dear," said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	441.83929443359375
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"	568.656982421875
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	585.611083984375
i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."	343.59765625
darcy!"	956.6610107421875
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	598.7950439453125
despite these efforts, project gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.	1580.414306640625
"indeed i do not dare."	295.5337829589844
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!	1816.742431640625
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	856.53515625
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs. bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	552.4669189453125
i grieve to
     find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared w. was not a man to be trusted.	691.9156494140625
good girl!	702.7510375976562
as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	936.8177490234375
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	440.4278564453125
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!	682.5377807617188
i know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have
     still something more to ask of the former.	451.8168640136719
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	554.4454345703125
mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	620.2622680664062
said she.	897.8517456054688
lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and
mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	972.492919921875
have all her friends left her?"	418.3104553222656
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	781.1238403320312
you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	1969.02783203125
unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	767.059814453125
it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.	1024.13427734375
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	1504.0281982421875
much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going
to be married.	705.6868896484375
even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and
monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	1074.73388671875
elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	565.66455078125
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."	461.8052673339844
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.	1030.6224365234375

transcriber's note:

spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	1378.1160888671875
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	819.443359375
"it did.	341.731201171875
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	462.0462341308594
he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."	444.5224609375
while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	1344.8819580078125
he was very fond of them."	290.1268310546875
mr. darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	726.9066162109375
i appeal to mr. darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	1114.5157470703125
"oh!	376.5555419921875
but if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, i must be more explicit.	790.9935302734375
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	1938.12744140625
he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr. hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	764.7852172851562
his affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	826.005859375
chapter xvi.	1442.7066650390625
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr. bennet, "and
nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	574.9512329101562
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	780.202880859375
very
nonsensical to come at all!	344.9001770019531
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	653.9514770507812
some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening.	421.0653381347656
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	1059.725341796875
i know not what to think.	246.82095336914062
when mr. collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	678.5725708007812
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	936.4649047851562
mr. darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	448.0838928222656
"mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	586.4686889648438
she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	676.657470703125
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	654.1701049804688
stop me whilst you can."	427.3612060546875
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!	1071.4007568359375
the foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united
states.	1920.7381591796875
but she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	958.45361328125
my father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	793.1973876953125
i saw them the night before last."	479.6995849609375
by this time she is
actually with them!	325.360595703125
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."	619.854248046875
"oh, lord!	1120.089599609375
i can hardly write for
     laughing.	1549.614990234375
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will
     immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.	1017.9631958007812
darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	686.7845458984375
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	610.3138427734375
she directly replied,

"you need not be frightened.	466.41522216796875
if mr. darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	993.195068359375
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	906.2175903320312
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	369.40863037109375
--cried elizabeth.	378.0333251953125
may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	979.7688598632812
they found mr. bennet still up.	514.6339721679688
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn.	742.1659545898438
oh!	inf
it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	745.9075317382812
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear.	1137.09814453125
elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	1078.19970703125
it is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
     think of us.	354.7580871582031
poor
jane!	479.55255126953125
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	636.8932495117188
"if i," said mr. collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	624.2135009765625
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	672.1168823242188
"and have you heard from him often?"	500.4313049316406
but that is one great difference between
us.	829.7703247070312
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	528.6870727539062
it seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	839.2736206054688
it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	1262.1959228515625
who should suffer but myself?	953.3621826171875
it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	960.9989624023438
let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr.
darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has
treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner.	690.3765869140625
his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	638.1612548828125
elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.	607.992431640625
mr. wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return.	888.4364013671875
our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's character.	1187.21923828125
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	862.0391845703125
pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	1015.8926391601562
the least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	752.5521240234375
"i know them a little.	350.326904296875
i thought i should have died.	1284.6612548828125
she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	438.2119140625
not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
i know are all chance in this world.	858.2162475585938
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	716.626953125
from his garden, mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	903.0160522460938
she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	388.0376892089844
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "project gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1
through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
project gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or
1.e.9.	1043.500244140625
vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	820.815673828125
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	1070.8170166015625
"i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!"	532.4957885742188
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	719.5596923828125
said elizabeth.	851.0508422851562
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried elizabeth.	508.7821350097656
jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	720.1181640625
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	902.0911865234375
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	628.6549682617188
we know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	1454.63427734375
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	261.7611389160156
how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	744.8927612304688
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.	446.41424560546875
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt
that i _should_ be looked at.	639.7550048828125
oh!	inf
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	516.3230590820312
they met again on sunday, and
     then _i_ saw him too.	581.711669921875
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	829.964599609375
she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
darcy did not wish for cards; and mr. hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	1227.419677734375
i will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	472.587158203125
and is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	896.9916381835938
she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	755.4147338867188
but it is all, all too late now."	395.23358154296875
but enough of this.	188.3118896484375
"my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	563.6715087890625
chapter i.


elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	857.856201171875
my sole dependence was on you; and
i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	419.61480712890625
limited warranty, disclaimer of damages - except for the "right
of replacement or refund" described in paragraph 1.f.3, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation, the owner of the project
gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a project
gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.	1341.116455078125
it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	832.4640502929688
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn-house.	2766.41162109375
of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	381.68597412109375
he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	1226.6854248046875
the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	723.1583251953125
"if he wants our society, let
him seek it.	958.2913818359375
jane was not happy.	497.86907958984375
mr. wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	869.585205078125
elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	597.7814331054688
mr. collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs. bennet.	485.6018371582031
the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine.	695.280517578125
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady
catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."	420.43878173828125
cried his wife impatiently.	1291.1512451171875
he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it."	301.131103515625
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs. bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided
she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i
told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	530.471923828125
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	586.4471435546875
how could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"	1385.1390380859375
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."	731.8006591796875
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	694.76318359375
on the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	1172.624267578125
mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	538.3197021484375
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	589.4711303710938
yours ever,

     "caroline bingley."	525.3840942382812
cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	684.099853515625
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	1097.3958740234375
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	573.8146362304688
there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	708.2587280273438
"_you_ were mr. bingley's first choice."	653.9180908203125
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	1322.041015625
cried lydia.	347.88385009765625
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!	571.5797119140625
it distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
parsonage.	460.6211853027344
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."	475.6328125
"how despicably have i acted!"	1236.19384765625
chapter x.


more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
meet mr.	1378.9423828125
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	585.7116088867188
"oh!	376.5555419921875
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	879.9136352539062
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or
rather taller."	784.4794921875
lady catherine seemed pleased.	575.7213134765625
after sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london,
mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	550.9371337890625
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."	528.7120361328125
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady
catherine.	392.9245300292969
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	583.25537109375
contact the
foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	2004.2562255859375
the
other is miss de bourgh.	489.533935546875
elizabeth was delighted.	822.0792236328125
"wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as jane's."	513.234619140625
mr. bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	460.0498046875
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness.	591.7525634765625
there was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	312.95245361328125
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	758.00439453125
our situation
with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	750.4326171875
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	591.7471923828125
"oh!"	832.247314453125
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	1357.704345703125
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	746.31591796875
chapter ix.	873.39794921875
here comes hill.	2263.314453125
"how strange this is!	617.8243408203125
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	440.1177673339844
this will never do."	143.71189880371094
bingley?"	550.1007690429688
"yes, sir, i know i am.	344.1956787109375
what is to become of us!	588.7803344726562
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	945.1373901367188
"when i consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew
what he was.	488.19891357421875
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.	475.28253173828125
but
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	971.2754516601562
besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."	373.6094970703125
absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr. collins.	937.26416015625
"good god!	2484.90185546875
"indeed, mr. bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	419.06890869140625
"yours, &c."

"well, my dear," said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr. bingley, and under your orders."	552.8461303710938
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	804.4542236328125
what hours of transport we shall spend!	1556.891845703125
said mr. gardiner.	737.50927734375
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married.	478.49658203125
from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	810.56494140625
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	1137.01904296875
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	685.9158935546875
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	751.9290771484375
till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr. darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself.	503.6746520996094
i told mrs. collins so before you came.	406.06243896484375
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	868.1430053710938
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"i am not."	511.8567199707031
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	1121.6668701171875
if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"	671.664794921875
perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	1390.3468017578125
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	1355.980712890625
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	767.4952392578125
no
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	908.19580078125
darcy said
nothing at all.	497.319580078125
had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	509.3872985839844
cried bingley.	459.5987854003906
_that_ is all settled."	366.0172119140625
i am not romantic you know.	904.7892456054688
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?"	525.1323852539062
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	396.6529846191406
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends.	437.607421875
but i knew i should
persuade you at last.	638.044677734375
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	450.8875427246094
i quite detest the man."	634.709228515625
i am sick of them all.	756.5953369140625
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	799.9149780273438
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	700.1214599609375
she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	597.6719970703125
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	418.946044921875
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	458.524658203125
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	571.9829711914062
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	559.62646484375
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	1352.693603515625
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do, when i
tell you all."	429.86322021484375
has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	2230.8486328125
every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	745.2938842773438
to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	5462.3203125
she is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	1036.93603515625
the
possibility of meeting mr. darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	1201.7489013671875
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	514.2078857421875
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	1117.9515380859375
in anticipating the happiness of bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	445.18768310546875
mrs. bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	1192.2257080078125
as they drove to mr. gardiner's
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	767.28369140625
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	622.7495727539062
all field sports were over.	1211.2066650390625
[illustration: dove-dale]




pride & prejudice.	2897.259033203125
_she_ will not be able to help calling."	657.52978515625
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!	286.16607666015625
i shall see her in january.	1201.995849609375
chapter xvii.	724.4529418945312
but think no more of the letter.	209.443359375
have not you always hated him?"	1010.03076171875
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	564.7730102539062
for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	1483.9837646484375
darcy."	58.02021408081055
but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."	628.3237915039062
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	695.8323974609375
every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections.	794.5010986328125
the discussion of mr. collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	729.5975341796875
let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	564.6787719726562
"what does mr. darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?"	409.74298095703125
they
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	537.3892211914062
well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	250.36434936523438
"with my mother up stairs.	701.0097045898438
and when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; mr. bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	733.4205322265625
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	3984.4990234375
lord!	inf
lord bless me!	522.76171875
that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!	604.6015625
her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,

"i can guess the subject of your reverie."	426.9495849609375
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	687.0419921875
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.	380.2107849121094
his marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy."	618.2820434570312
"no more have i," said mr. bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."	389.3023986816406
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."	639.830078125
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be
placed in the gallery at pemberley.	675.6203002929688
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
mrs. bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	577.3785400390625
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	502.3391418457031
though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	654.0728149414062
i am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	738.3302001953125
she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	471.6369323730469
after a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	1130.2232666015625
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."	593.8675537109375
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning.	605.2424926757812
there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	873.2293090820312
we had better go into the
avenue."	544.5728149414062
she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	450.6803283691406
he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	398.7427978515625
you see how continually we are engaged there.	779.003662109375
but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	676.1878662109375
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	966.4564819335938
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	624.0572509765625
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."	981.6337890625
how odious i should think them!"	561.5427856445312
"he brought it with him for us to see."	427.3341064453125
he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	1214.3282470703125
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	317.6163635253906
"and is this all?"	298.8737487792969
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	577.9727172851562
"what could become of mr. bingley and jane!"	541.5221557617188
we want none of them;
do we?"	540.2027587890625
his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	970.5430908203125
he has heartily forgiven me
now."	1444.360107421875
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	1470.39990234375
the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	679.1154174804688
"nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	491.27886962890625
"never, sir."	267.97845458984375
but mrs.
bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	255.2263946533203
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
saying,

"i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	556.5538940429688
at length the parsonage was discernible.	678.166259765625
cried he.	316.0864562988281
her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	900.1919555664062
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved
in civility."	747.7672119140625
her own thoughts were employing her.	1162.838134765625
"i beg your pardon.	644.184814453125
they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	442.6714172363281
if i was to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better.	386.281494140625
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	825.3515014648438
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	518.18994140625
mr. collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	895.010498046875
the officers will find
women better worth their notice.	1531.0145263671875
they are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	891.084228515625
colonel forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.	1154.104248046875
three daughters married!	1115.866455078125
can i speak plainer?	1761.3258056640625
but he found, in reply to
     this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	761.3819580078125
but the case is
this.	333.34576416015625
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	1072.9002685546875
mr. darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.	561.8738403320312
mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	448.1738586425781
mrs. bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	665.6292724609375
"has your governess left you?"	818.1709594726562
"yes, in conjunction with his friend."	528.861328125
"did charlotte dine with you?"	496.48553466796875
her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	595.97412109375
no, no, this is not likely.	195.50904846191406
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!	360.6871643066406
during their walk, it was resolved that mr. bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	425.7387390136719
"dining out," said mrs. bennet, "that is very unlucky."	279.06201171875
her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	822.2815551757812
"yes, madam," said mrs. bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	338.6249084472656
but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say, very agreeable.	538.9042358398438
could there be
finer symptoms?	2648.2890625
ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	277.73541259765625
no principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy.	482.0402526855469
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	383.0004577636719
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the
     address specified in section 4, "information about donations to
     the project gutenberg literary archive foundation."	895.8187255859375
a young man, such
as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	802.330810546875
it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr. collins joining
in, observed,

"yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her.	624.5442504882812
and so
she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	553.3574829101562
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	536.0635375976562
"you either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire."	788.498291015625
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look
on as a point of duty.	918.805419921875
it is unaccountable!	2745.870361328125
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	749.1998291015625
this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	642.2892456054688
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	549.9053955078125
and when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	553.5506591796875
it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in."	703.1056518554688
it is of all subjects my delight.	717.2994384765625
they had long wished to see him.	472.5360107421875
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	700.5148315429688
a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	849.4376220703125
she was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr.	800.9061889648438
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	570.184326171875
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	481.44873046875
chapter xi.	282.94476318359375
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	594.0343627929688
you will find her manners beyond any
thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	1025.9486083984375
i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better."	546.8786010742188
we passed each other
several times.	1372.008544921875
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."	854.6906127929688
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	542.3222045898438
but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable.	564.04931640625
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	826.34619140625
he was silent.	955.453857421875
elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley.	523.5350341796875
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	564.8567504882812
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	1239.268798828125
"your's sincerely, &c."

miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	804.2800903320312
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	399.3450012207031
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	379.94384765625
"a man who has once been refused!	1081.47705078125
it was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	482.165771484375
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	560.8973388671875
if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	466.38787841796875
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george
wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the
late mr. darcy's steward.	676.8923950195312
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	580.4379272460938
i am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.	648.5725708007812
what has she to do with it?	367.1725158691406
and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr. collins thus
addressed her,

"when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."	702.465576171875
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	686.1586303710938
the possibility of mr. collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"engaged to mr. collins!	632.5986938476562
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in
address that he improves?	644.8252563476562
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	325.2734069824219
so, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."	451.0752868652344
darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	455.7569580078125
it is really too distressing.	1957.353515625
mr. collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	711.0032958984375
no one made any reply.	1402.6231689453125
mr. gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	1205.260498046875
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.	863.7063598632812
what will become of me.	415.0697937011719
"sometimes.	414.87213134765625
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	579.0888671875
were it known to the rest
of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	375.5357971191406
but, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	773.432861328125
how unlucky!	283.13360595703125
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	301.3872375488281
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	584.6807861328125
"you judge very properly," said mr. bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	608.4758911132812
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	463.3468322753906
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	462.02880859375
but that
gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	417.1354675292969
elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	739.4812622070312
mrs. bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	1358.7431640625
scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	942.809814453125
the business was therefore soon settled.	616.857666015625
i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	571.8773803710938
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	841.27978515625
this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself."	508.6040954589844
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."	801.6485595703125
let me advise you then, my dear sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.	1003.7431030273438
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	699.7976684570312
the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."	669.373046875
his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	923.8228149414062
he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	1056.7652587890625
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
mr. collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	593.3506469726562
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	463.7161865234375
she
could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	792.052978515625
her father lifted up his eyes.	2037.6094970703125
"yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	402.2662353515625
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	583.1196899414062
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	637.4343872070312
it would be such a delicious scheme,
and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	704.1279907226562
i am so
grieved for him.	600.14111328125
her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr. bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	792.577392578125
put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	676.0340576171875
why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	681.1014404296875
miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	798.0679931640625
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	730.565673828125
we have not met since the 26th of november, when
we were all dancing together at netherfield."	611.7666015625
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	724.149658203125
had i known what
i ought, what i dared, to do!	378.9224853515625
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	614.5966186523438
what are we to do!"	294.80401611328125
why any fear of detection?	1718.4134521484375
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!	648.5592651367188
it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	369.2620849609375
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	843.0366821289062
i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly.	679.3881225585938
when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	939.8594360351562
darcy?"	390.2454528808594
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	482.748046875
you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
     wickham.	453.53765869140625
he scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	431.622802734375
chapter xiv.	902.8795776367188
you know i always
speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	555.162109375
"so, lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love i find.	423.5795593261719
but perhaps mr. bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."	499.47698974609375
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	854.8365478515625
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	494.028076171875
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	680.6160888671875
all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	604.2755737304688
and her calling here was prodigiously
civil!	2754.969482421875
i
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	826.4987182617188
this was agreed to, and mrs. philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	1041.6280517578125
again she read on.	379.84039306640625
charlotte did not stay much
longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	463.1169128417969
on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	599.859619140625
"i certainly shall not.	428.8356628417969
that is the place to get
husbands.	778.1349487304688
if this be the case, he deserves you.	783.75830078125
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	985.0552978515625
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs.
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	475.4922180175781
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	636.1414794921875
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	746.2568359375
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	1141.6864013671875
i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	273.21746826171875
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	792.1995239257812
such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	822.06591796875
our distress, my
     dear lizzy, is very great.	400.908203125
the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	839.562255859375
"gracechurch-street, monday,

     august 2.	5550.9541015625
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	1111.24267578125
"oh!	376.5555419921875
do not repeat what i then said.	717.4540405273438
"i have not a doubt of mr. bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	539.999267578125
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr.	564.010009765625
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	363.02239990234375
mrs. bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last.'	415.9833984375
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr.	777.8815307617188
she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	624.0283813476562
"you never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	496.31298828125
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	385.70428466796875
let me never see either
one or the other again!"	614.9624633789062
i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	724.936767578125
after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth,

"i hope you are well, miss bennet.	284.46466064453125
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	342.8319091796875
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	736.5438232421875
mr. collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	486.1796875
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	867.8060913085938
no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	1968.703857421875
"i see no occasion for that.	568.1133422851562
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	844.5576171875
said elizabeth.	851.0508422851562
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	512.1809692382812
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	829.7161254882812
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	594.9335327148438
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."	747.66845703125
when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	476.4613342285156
her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	769.3697509765625
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	390.3735046386719
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"	647.19287109375
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_.	702.215087890625
bingley was by no means deficient,
but darcy was clever.	645.9130859375
it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	606.7789306640625
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr. darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	933.2633666992188
_my_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."	596.4259033203125
when they
had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said,

"this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	656.1388549804688
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	540.14990234375
she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."	513.8826293945312
"good heavens!"	3046.604248046875
you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	949.1451416015625
in three volumes.	3989.339111328125
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"	670.1666259765625
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr. gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	675.3983764648438
jane was distressed.	717.9300537109375
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	446.07440185546875
i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun."	711.6124877929688
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."	647.3231201171875
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	603.9667358398438
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs. bennet, alarmed.	855.761962890625
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	735.7277221679688
jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw mr. darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	388.43572998046875
"what do you mean?"	444.9334411621094
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.	878.7953491210938
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention.	472.8182067871094
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	797.141845703125
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	595.8726806640625
mr. collins made his
declaration in form.	1052.008544921875
i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_i_ have seen nothing of it."	692.4166259765625
and
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.	1283.1851806640625
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	616.1815185546875
what made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	700.260009765625
but
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	550.9931030273438
"would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	998.765869140625
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	1299.8521728515625
lady catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
darcy.	930.8438110351562
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	472.0572204589844
i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	386.40472412109375
"dear sir,

     "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	576.3123779296875
"i hope not so.	181.21585083007812
that tall, proud man."	1014.7335815429688
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	685.2572021484375
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	1188.89892578125
his doing so
drew her notice.	600.9297485351562
i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."	759.4305419921875
however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."	430.8574523925781
"something very much to the purpose of course.	477.09722900390625
a
most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	1642.240478515625
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	460.9362487792969
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	1443.4195556640625
"not as you represent it.	1038.9949951171875
chapter xix.	419.2162170410156
"yet why did he come?"	528.4856567382812
she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	512.134033203125
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
pemberley.	616.8638305664062
mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	726.5469360351562
then shewing
her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	925.0010375976562
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and mrs. bennet, i am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.	563.8868408203125
these recollections will not do at
all.	492.5445861816406
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	418.63092041015625
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with.	440.65911865234375
kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, mrs. forster and me are _such_ friends!)	513.730224609375
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	848.0405883789062
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	609.5547485351562
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	282.4971923828125
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	836.645263671875
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	535.2964477539062
there
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr. darcy could have
such boundless influence.	983.6907958984375
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	552.2401123046875
they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	560.699462890625
this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	604.608154296875
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"oh, papa, what news?	748.3978271484375
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	488.1495666503906
oh!	inf
but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	1126.8663330078125
i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done."	654.5164794921875
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	768.5301513671875
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	676.6887817382812
it was
unpardonable.	2754.29443359375
she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	1091.4117431640625
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	580.56884765625
mr. bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!	596.6474609375
he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	652.7454833984375
as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	405.38201904296875
this
unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	721.4837036132812
"it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	736.3580932617188
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	535.428955078125
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.	1165.7178955078125
what news?	342.84661865234375
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	564.104736328125
at first there
seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	1038.3348388671875
and it was not wholly without foundation.	435.6278991699219
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	807.7191162109375
but you are always giving _her_ the
preference."	801.648193359375
he has given in all his debts; i hope
     at least he has not deceived us.	623.6238403320312
be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	1185.683837890625
"i am sure there is not on _his_.	734.3338623046875
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	1414.976318359375
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm
license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	938.0631103515625
but i know the
foundation is unjust.	718.1112060546875
"this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	2009.786865234375
i rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.	984.1107177734375
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	964.5164184570312
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr. bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	604.287109375
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	589.86083984375
my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."	790.0296630859375
said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	279.9616394042969
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	315.5065612792969
after tea, mr. bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	595.306396484375
are the others coming out?"	810.9747314453125
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.	718.0968017578125
he must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.	342.0159912109375
it is a pity they are not handsome!	726.868896484375
lydia laughed, and said,

"aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	635.6532592773438
your tempers are by no means unlike.	649.1783447265625
mr. bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	1372.78857421875
"mr.	153.1029052734375
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	404.1510009765625
if you
do not charge anything for copies of this ebook, complying with the
rules is very easy.	1637.28857421875
_her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	1494.7943115234375
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	420.1722106933594
when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	443.72174072265625
"money!	120.9588851928711
but little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	699.7606201171875
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	588.6890869140625
and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry.	732.423095703125
--my mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right
     honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the church of england.	1056.1072998046875
he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	966.0228881835938
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	928.550537109375
i should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	491.501953125
i do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr.	583.30712890625
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	333.34844970703125
"what sort of a girl is miss darcy?"	469.5928039550781
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr. bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	359.83062744140625
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	774.6907348632812
i will
think no more about him."	278.1364440917969
*       *       *       *       *

"good gracious!"	717.8663940429688
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	1134.591064453125
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	620.9035034179688
and i think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.	878.218505859375
i must find mr. gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	615.7321166992188
but let me advise you to think better of it.	509.6912536621094
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	564.4822387695312
mrs. bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth,

"miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	761.57080078125
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."	571.8923950195312
oh, that i knew how it was!"	419.84698486328125
she wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	693.1456909179688
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	202.4952850341797
ten thousand a year!	589.8057250976562
her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	594.2249755859375
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	714.5621948242188
the foundation's principal office is located at 4557 melan dr. s.
fairbanks, ak, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
throughout numerous locations.	4232.39794921875
she then took a large house in edward-street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	928.9447021484375

this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	1193.568115234375
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	563.1334228515625
an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	392.8512878417969
we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."	718.5016479492188
this is my advice.	925.9290771484375
it would have been strange if they had.	668.0414428710938
if you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,
in which you have been brought up."	431.6600646972656
but i must tell you how it went off.	558.3616943359375
however, i
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for mr. darcy might have done as well."	715.7400512695312
i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."	501.5875549316406
but i was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	548.8276977539062
mr. gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	899.8756103515625
it must be my uncle's doings!	793.3899536132812
but it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	851.5659790039062
whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	1482.0899658203125
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	414.8268127441406
how can mr. bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	710.9927978515625
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	1428.8416748046875
said mrs. bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	446.6145935058594
i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	880.417724609375
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	438.7988586425781
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	766.726318359375
who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	469.70166015625
when they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be
soon married to mr.	735.64599609375
good heaven!	451.6365966796875
they will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from
     mrs. gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the south.	676.2665405273438
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	796.3763427734375
mr.
     darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	650.6792602539062
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	1670.2589111328125
repeated mr. bennet.	378.390380859375
it was
the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	501.15771484375
"but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day."	590.3909912109375
when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	826.45458984375
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	542.8140258789062

chapter xix.	419.2162170410156
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr. collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	619.7989501953125
nobody can tell what i
suffer!--but it is always so.	552.7536010742188
mr. darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	538.4046630859375
he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	583.7520751953125
"nothing child, nothing.	686.3196411132812
if you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.	1139.718994140625
five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs.
bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	422.4473571777344
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	796.7196655273438
and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	550.1320190429688
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	549.587158203125
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for
elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	829.6793212890625
i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	825.218505859375
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	532.717529296875
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	1091.049560546875
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	436.5659484863281
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	439.113037109375
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	1428.98681640625
i speak
feelingly.	1801.5123291015625
said he,
with a look of doubt.	323.99493408203125
the
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!	487.1784973144531
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	547.749267578125
i _must_ have employment and society.	1288.660888671875
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr. darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself."	564.0713500976562
the very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	919.760986328125
but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	670.7916870117188
and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	606.1170043945312
her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	1358.750244140625
they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	267.1996154785156
"my dear mr. bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	458.3760070800781
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs.
gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	765.4685668945312
"one of them does."	471.556884765625
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	476.6124572753906
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	456.52996826171875
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving
home.	806.5313720703125
five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	623.6690063476562
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	998.4715576171875
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	675.81396484375
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	1134.26220703125
oh, lydia!"	281.33734130859375
jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	2829.04443359375
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	783.6820678710938
"that it ought not to be attempted.	531.9760131835938
1813.	inf
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	656.12451171875
she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	571.6704711914062
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	989.9732055664062

i need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	834.746826171875
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"in vain have i struggled.	634.64111328125
"oh!	376.5555419921875
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	539.0556030273438
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	654.759033203125
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	670.770263671875
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	597.8025512695312
it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	631.4923095703125
but the
clothes, the wedding clothes!	1388.892333984375
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they?	492.70831298828125
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	1201.8692626953125
in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs. collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to mrs. collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	685.4879150390625
wickham only shook his head.	1212.7398681640625
wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i
     had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with
     others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the
     dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that
     ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made
     acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that
     bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.	707.3370361328125
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr.
hurst had a house.	811.3952026367188
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	981.5958862304688
but you know married women have never much time for
writing.	669.7296142578125
but to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!	629.8572387695312
"it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	643.9298706054688
she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	602.7719116210938
but what is that to me?	280.08489990234375
consider mr. collins's respectability, and
charlotte's prudent, steady character.	1190.597412109375
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,"
said he.	515.9364624023438
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	915.9423828125
"and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	918.1629028320312
"oh!	376.5555419921875
he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	746.1337890625
the power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	538.5541381835938
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	732.2677001953125
at night she opened her heart to jane.	554.0030517578125
only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	513.32177734375
it is what every body says.	701.6183471679688
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	564.6402587890625
my sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel
     fitzwilliam, and myself.	525.1271362304688
what is it you are talking
of?	394.2696533203125
"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	596.7308349609375
to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	1394.9434814453125
this is your final resolve!	1615.6646728515625
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	313.9218444824219
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	578.3680419921875
that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr. bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	622.0037841796875
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	362.4189453125
mr. bennet made no answer.	488.4678649902344
bennet."	56.81926727294922
said she, as she looked in
her face.	281.753662109375
in the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
elizabeth, said,

"miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."	593.70556640625
now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	715.4019165039062
little more than half a day's
journey.	831.3263549804688
lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her
party.	619.42431640625
had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	652.875
you and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the
party."	396.11260986328125
for
     about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.	517.2891235351562
those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs. forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	592.37646484375
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	823.5219116210938
it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	808.4107666015625
1813.	inf
the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	771.638916015625
they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	527.7747802734375
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	643.8973388671875
she read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	658.3285522460938
darcy made no answer.	518.5612182617188
mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	362.291748046875
had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	506.6611022949219
we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	959.0794677734375
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	1226.93994140625
she could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	655.865478515625
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	363.6101989746094
there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	625.2537231445312
another day i will do the same; i will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	641.1824340820312
she was very
equal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	695.0385131835938
"indeed i am.	336.47918701171875
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	784.8709106445312
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	1240.8280029296875
cried elizabeth.	338.4321594238281
you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing."	879.89599609375
tell him i hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	619.4461669921875
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	416.5491027832031
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	719.6348876953125
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	725.012451171875
"very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	660.9581298828125
did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in kent?"	424.9292907714844
mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	539.75830078125
at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr.
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	861.54150390625
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	385.2875671386719
this letter is from mr.	481.5286560058594

confusion, lest they had been overheard.	487.11090087890625
i hate such false
friends.	1159.711181640625
the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr. wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.	880.4046630859375
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	398.6129455566406
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	389.7699279785156
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	1197.93505859375
"certainly.	292.015380859375
well, monday morning came, and i was in

the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia's infamy somewhat better.	748.1409912109375
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.	1051.48046875
but i make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	633.3689575195312
it was only said, 'lately,
george wickham, esq.	1729.318115234375
"no, she would go home.	277.2613220214844
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr. bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever i saw.	346.32952880859375
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"	609.9970092773438
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	583.878173828125
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	645.2518310546875
chapter xviii.	455.8221435546875
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	1494.7501220703125
thank heaven!	165.3951416015625
mrs. bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	457.5315856933594
"it is _not_ mr. bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life."	404.107666015625
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	509.2857971191406
cried
jane.	412.1280822753906
it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	686.7003784179688
give me farther particulars.	1733.4700927734375
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	326.7321472167969
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	644.7828369140625
would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	780.9119262695312
"indeed!"	167.5218505859375
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	1231.739013671875
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr. collins was wishing to
marry you.	410.3712158203125
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	1288.3370361328125
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i'm the tallest."	784.8491821289062
at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."	718.2388916015625
it was all
     over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.	981.935302734375
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	810.9078369140625
it was dated
from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.	890.372802734375
"can you come to-morrow?"	922.5941772460938
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	744.2742919921875
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	579.6422119140625
i thought i should have broke my heart."	628.9646606445312
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	1480.066650390625
her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	1433.6728515625
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	548.545166015625
oh!	inf
not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	1305.8564453125
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	1171.5477294921875
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	788.29345703125
for
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	603.07666015625
sir, i do indeed.	296.72259521484375
"how strange!"	1354.750244140625
if you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
     se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as
     lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.	956.4461669921875
you are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	287.38421630859375
elizabeth made no answer.	459.38299560546875
she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	824.1944580078125
it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	589.317138671875
"_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs. bennet with civil
self-command to miss lucas.	511.57440185546875
the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs. bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	801.159423828125
she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr. collins
instead!	739.2006225585938
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	1533.960205078125
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	466.5175476074219
one seems so forlorn without them."	750.3875122070312
"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	733.354736328125
"and they _must_ marry!	2008.422607421875
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	568.1000366210938
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."	460.99298095703125
to know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	364.55810546875
"how can you talk so?"	615.2070922851562
"i hope not."	108.97882080078125
chapter xvii.	724.4529418945312
my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	910.255615234375
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	1162.584228515625
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	1192.323974609375
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	503.08343505859375
"no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose.	498.2039489746094
1.f.3.	inf
what is your own opinion?"	645.6174926757812
she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	611.4111328125
mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	836.611328125
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	648.9781494140625
your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."	647.818115234375
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	566.2725830078125
it was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	966.9635009765625
he
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr. darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	709.3416748046875
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr.
bingley, if she could.	318.19891357421875
from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him.	616.2023315429688
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	438.2821350097656
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	905.3226928710938
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	631.1455078125
dear me!	613.6361083984375
"yes, very handsome."	348.591064453125
you
may have drawn him in."	723.1566162109375
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr. gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist
mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	615.1416625976562
to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	1185.9388427734375
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	342.6304016113281
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	401.13897705078125
"bingley."	132.86920166015625
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's
attractions.	746.883056640625
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	1746.965087890625
"mr.
collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	910.8804321289062
well, well, i only hope it
will last.	268.1067810058594
adieu.	inf
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr. bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	565.6974487304688
international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

_invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._

_engraved for no.	6078.38818359375
"but how did he account for
it?"	417.4972229003906
on finding
mrs. bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"	448.01446533203125
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	578.996337890625
well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	453.02020263671875
mary and kitty, thank
heaven!	6461.09375
for your
sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss
bennet?"	769.0557861328125
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers."	725.357177734375
well!	inf
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."	422.68756103515625
"_that_ is a failing indeed!"	737.79345703125
oh,
lord!	1861.190673828125
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	659.277587890625
from
what can it proceed?	724.3023681640625
chapter xvi.	1442.7066650390625
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	455.63787841796875
it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	720.6519775390625
the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	928.61962890625
the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	734.4249267578125
darcy."	58.02021408081055
"i am trying to make it out."	497.6229553222656
"you look pale.	2995.666015625
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible
that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	698.0929565429688
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	803.0951538085938
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	1147.8349609375
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	586.1692504882812
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	798.697265625
poor kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.	959.9693603515625
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley.	387.86102294921875
i really do not think georgiana
darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	905.6137084960938
mrs.
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	681.0884399414062
the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	560.68017578125
the
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	703.419189453125

"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."	586.184326171875
but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	527.4426879882812
you know not what you are
about."	244.8937530517578
chapter ii.	728.00244140625
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	946.1302490234375
but now it was all too natural.	864.9353637695312
shocking!"	549.9586181640625
if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	674.8076171875
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	589.3699340820312
"you are mistaken.	503.97613525390625

colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	563.9390258789062
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	741.8213500976562
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes.	474.0191650390625
it became her turn to listen.	732.5103759765625
the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	1045.2801513671875
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	712.3556518554688
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	732.933837890625
"we never had any governess."	585.8202514648438
as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	629.5413818359375
i am sincerely grieved for him and
     mrs. f. but no one can throw any blame on them.	1024.642822265625
we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	1574.2032470703125
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	768.86474609375
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	879.05810546875
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	562.6527099609375
stay, stay, i will go myself.	386.68084716796875
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	428.0591125488281
"this is not to be borne.	496.9004821777344
i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	541.8726806640625
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	1193.0770263671875
i pity, though i
     cannot help blaming her.	392.1240234375
but the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."	906.8867797851562
miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	398.961669921875
chapter xv.	1155.2379150390625
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	756.3770751953125
lydia's being settled in the
north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	534.31640625
1.f.6.	inf

but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	512.6092529296875
i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	791.4904174804688
come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.	328.8630676269531
mrs. gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly.	840.0628051757812
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	839.3592529296875
they were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	796.9970703125
"exceed their income!	911.0919799804688
such
doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly.	977.5872192382812
both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	823.733154296875
i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the
country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	600.9412231445312
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	625.13330078125
i do not trust my own
partiality.	1111.60888671875
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."	1028.4913330078125
darcy?"	390.2454528808594
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	803.300048828125
"wickham so
very bad!	933.90576171875
how rich
and how great you will be!	467.9871520996094
you
mentioned _two_ instances.	3723.2421875
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better.	498.6517028808594
"if i were as rich as mr. darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his
sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	538.357177734375

mr. collins and charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	883.6840209960938

natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	897.0053100585938

what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	764.6885986328125
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	968.7957763671875
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards mr. wickham.	905.8330688476562

how i long to see her!	425.0067138671875
my temper i dare not vouch
for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	695.7092895507812
at that moment, she cared for no other.	712.0734252929688
but i have
other provocations.	969.7020874023438
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	1246.13427734375
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	2393.48828125
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town
next saturday."	481.184814453125
let me hear what it is."	306.92547607421875
"really, mr. collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	482.96148681640625
'ah!	inf
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!	493.0229797363281
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	1176.9700927734375
darcy!"	956.6610107421875
she was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself.	1085.9676513671875
mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	569.4495849609375
did she call to refuse her consent?"	976.0580444335938
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."	599.9765625
at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	572.794921875
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	628.7769775390625
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	635.426025390625
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	1262.1400146484375
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	769.5565185546875
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	1098.90234375
it was not known that wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	466.22332763671875
"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said
elizabeth.	412.3116760253906
my dear lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.	554.4488525390625
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	594.81494140625
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."	597.5791015625
in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	1203.2672119140625
its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	757.5639038085938
every thing
that is charming!	795.4237060546875
the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	1111.5806884765625
miss lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	855.3547973632812
miss darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	650.06396484375
"i told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	548.863037109375
she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	582.906494140625
he could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	1064.611328125
_they_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	1473.032958984375
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	855.9113159179688
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan."	685.0615234375
"but what is to be
done about pemberley?"	442.0458068847656
he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."	543.624267578125
in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he
wants you in the library."	560.0504150390625
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	907.5745849609375
lady
catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	1057.35302734375
"with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it."	771.46923828125
the apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	460.8630676269531
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	734.510009765625
nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	709.85693359375
mr. darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	1068.060302734375
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."	457.16717529296875
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	545.2483520507812
and is it really true?	977.8683471679688
charlotte the wife of mr. collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	716.9735107421875
and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment.	377.890380859375
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	697.7454833984375
jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	524.7551879882812
if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it."	330.88525390625
he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	881.0333862304688
well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	432.4895324707031
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	448.611083984375
"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	395.62860107421875
cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	1157.7867431640625
i was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	608.2742919921875
rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	850.6345825195312
in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	434.1052551269531
my aunt philips came to longbourn
on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me.	620.093994140625
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	849.8075561523438
at length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	1249.546630859375
she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr. wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	1047.618896484375
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	951.3781127929688
to kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.	505.4697570800781
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	528.1332397460938
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia,
assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn.	1140.595947265625
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	1000.218017578125
having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	807.810791015625
"it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	612.40576171875
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	915.6030883789062
she followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!	883.697509765625
you may imagine what i felt
     and how i acted.	769.775634765625
it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."	810.2368774414062
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project
gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	1093.9554443359375
but our visitor
     was very obstinate.	1899.76806640625
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	745.506103515625
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	1177.774658203125
mr.
collins then returned to elizabeth.	565.8582763671875
and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	894.0682373046875
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	535.5923461914062
you have employed your
time much better.	1458.8695068359375
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	750.7640380859375
he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."	292.5340881347656
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	354.3591003417969
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	290.8627624511719
"is he married or single?"	663.1082763671875
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	649.218017578125
mr. darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	582.7333374023438
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	626.63330078125
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	1066.0830078125
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	594.5750732421875
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	309.8133544921875
your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	662.7810668945312
"no, no.	119.75843811035156
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	585.155517578125
i
thank you for explaining it so fully.	1203.044677734375
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	650.5297241210938
"that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	759.58984375
but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them.	702.325927734375
mr. wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	839.4193115234375
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	517.493408203125
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs.	731.6788330078125
but do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	508.8891296386719
but she is nothing to me now.	408.52056884765625
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	773.2857055664062
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	513.6366577148438
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	1823.712158203125
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	519.7811889648438
since her
father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."	692.3638305664062
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	567.1532592773438
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	657.0571899414062
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	699.972900390625
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	657.696044921875
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	684.3031005859375
"and do you like her?"	284.773681640625
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	406.10406494140625
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	593.974853515625
between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	1361.0731201171875
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	691.4552001953125
find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.'	394.03717041015625
it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	541.4124145507812
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	626.0210571289062
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	424.45501708984375
chapter vii.	352.73797607421875
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	689.6724243164062
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do.	569.6370239257812
he was
angry.	1434.288330078125
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	1399.2303466796875
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."	604.9513549804688
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil?	1183.917236328125
"if you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	522.8967895507812
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	692.2591552734375
--a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again.	629.5993041992188
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	844.873779296875
miss darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	603.8999633789062
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	397.0263366699219
he was on one side of her mother.	368.9613037109375
"what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?"	689.6132202148438
"but so we all do.	394.3687438964844
teazing, teazing, man!	2122.2265625
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."	431.9561462402344
he knows of my
     being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	422.5237121582031
the dejection was almost
universal.	1129.631591796875
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."	920.665771484375
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said
elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	579.4868774414062
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr.
wickham and herself.	439.1783447265625
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	1001.0606689453125
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	420.344970703125
"well, then--supposing them to be in london.	466.339599609375
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	788.8897705078125
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	1045.455078125
"not so hasty, if you please.	390.7196960449219
there can be no love in all this.	324.1939697265625
sir william did not say much.	409.97906494140625
i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	1368.169677734375
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	455.0850524902344
she seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	453.8156433105469
i know you will contrive it all."	516.2989501953125
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr. bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	455.57073974609375
to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	570.907470703125
"mr. darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	576.938232421875
but they did pass away, and mr. and
mrs. gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn.	466.36517333984375
you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	562.5025024414062
and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	775.8785400390625
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	377.66162109375
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	806.318359375
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	692.1904907226562
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	1735.867919921875
"it is a long time, mr. bingley, since you went away," said mrs. bennet.	308.0989685058594
but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."	601.7719116210938
let me do it without farther loss of time.	608.9644165039062
their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	799.987060546875
"and have you answered the letter?"	460.76727294921875
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	889.68701171875
you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."	576.536376953125
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	609.6573486328125
mr. darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	951.37451171875
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs. bennet give up the point.	339.7609558105469
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."	617.4791870117188
there was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	594.6275024414062
"books--oh!	767.8081665039062
"i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley's conduct to design,"
said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	559.8165283203125
come be quick, be quick!	1958.9295654296875
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."	266.99139404296875
we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	396.2542724609375
miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr. darcy looked
up.	779.39453125
"no, i believe not."	214.33299255371094
we have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
     approve.	492.2010803222656

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	729.4771728515625
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs. hurst and
elizabeth herself.	565.9888916015625
on this subject, what can you have to
say?	249.51185607910156
i have told miss bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
mrs. collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often
told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
mrs. jenkinson's room.	579.4332885742188
they will
ruin your happiness.	1490.735595703125
"but depend upon it, mr. collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	358.3621826171875
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	524.0162963867188
cried mrs. bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley!	543.6569213867188
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr. wickham.	677.703369140625
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	845.141357421875
"you are over scrupulous surely.	2122.108154296875
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	563.2805786132812
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	1075.89013671875
where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	2225.739013671875
from that moment i
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then
     perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had
     ever witnessed in him.	789.084716796875
i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	910.8704223632812
if he fears me, why come hither?	1852.10986328125
mrs. hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	962.2424926757812
it is useless to talk of it."	331.8453063964844
elizabeth was distressed.	668.5936889648438
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	1105.5113525390625
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	1503.37353515625
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards."	503.318359375

bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs.
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	708.5006103515625
a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	1373.5946044921875
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton.	343.65960693359375
"but not before they went to brighton?"	327.885986328125
it was mr. collins's picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	749.5053100585938
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	653.0238037109375

let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	1417.0694580078125
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	674.343505859375
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	862.2447509765625
she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
miss bingley.	674.7986450195312
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	1428.7060546875
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	939.400146484375
this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr. bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	470.2966613769531
lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	811.9041748046875
mr. darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr. bingley
never stirs without him."	728.305908203125
mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	743.3272705078125
darcy?"	390.2454528808594
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	802.0703125
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	1055.0699462890625
her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	482.94281005859375
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	395.0202941894531
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	693.5609741210938
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	1223.654541015625
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in derbyshire.	438.2432556152344
seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	637.6347045898438
other schemes too came into her head.	550.4815063476562
charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	736.353515625
it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	745.91357421875
the younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid.	1370.1295166015625
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	551.8468627929688

conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	864.5177001953125
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	291.2059631347656
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	360.3536376953125
i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	612.2247314453125
could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life
     saw him so affected.	368.855224609375
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	877.201904296875
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	451.2426452636719
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	1113.130615234375
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	345.7444152832031
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	810.452880859375
very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	621.1700439453125
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

lydia declared herself satisfied.	944.4161376953125
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	468.0793151855469
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	573.3190307617188
she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr. wickham
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."	757.0135498046875

the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	771.2831420898438
the
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."	968.5851440429688
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr. darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	915.1971435546875
we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	602.227783203125

but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	550.487548828125

jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	681.9525146484375
yes, yes.	2677.3095703125
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	419.4893798828125
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."	497.09552001953125
darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	761.2879638671875
it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs.
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	582.9581298828125
jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because i am a married woman."	363.9559326171875
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to
table.	380.74688720703125

easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an

important.	737.8800048828125
mr. darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!	534.4917602539062
"good gracious!	2316.673583984375
she could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	731.1699829101562
chapter xix.	419.2162170410156
but so they always are.	473.6407165527344
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	280.0390930175781
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	567.4906005859375
his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	533.482421875
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	770.488037109375
do
you often dance at st.	1636.9404296875
my dear, dear
lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	600.85498046875
with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs. bingley and talked of mrs. darcy may be guessed.	894.594482421875
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	824.2922973632812
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,

"indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	508.13671875
she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	1082.8099365234375
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	515.4146728515625
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	480.56591796875
there are a few
things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	585.9373168945312
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr. darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	444.03985595703125
this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	572.0167846679688
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i
     laugh.	978.220458984375
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr. collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	931.0466918945312
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	491.5804748535156
the moral will be perfectly fair.	798.0496826171875
how mr. darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	314.0886535644531
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	561.751708984375
but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	757.1778564453125
i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	508.4704895019531
to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	610.2155151367188
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	521.6821899414062
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said elizabeth.	976.6702270507812
how acutely did she now
feel it.	487.4173583984375
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	661.6641845703125
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	596.1134033203125
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	645.95654296875
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	1581.8331298828125
she dreaded seeing wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	405.6391906738281
i was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	625.396240234375
elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	850.769287109375
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	590.3400268554688
why did she come?	702.2227783203125
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	373.04803466796875
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	1780.28125
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	498.8774108886719
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	782.0641479492188
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	697.26123046875
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	760.3269653320312
said she.	897.8517456054688
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	874.32470703125
my temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."	890.5040283203125
you take
delight in vexing me.	1520.491455078125
he has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."	998.079345703125
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	387.9176330566406
i wish i could see her.	358.85943603515625
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	605.6575927734375
such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	1183.013671875
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	627.6464233398438
and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north.	449.8125305175781
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"	395.40777587890625
his
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	804.4258422851562
the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	692.7805786132812
"my dear sir," replied mr. collins, "i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	575.1105346679688
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	407.7164306640625
mr. darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	787.5074462890625
mrs. bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	562.7686157226562
he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	436.31121826171875
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	784.7586669921875
you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	770.153076171875
if your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.	707.6605224609375
they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	662.5523071289062
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	612.0070190429688
but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	514.173583984375
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?"	649.9010009765625
mr. bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	1007.2926025390625
it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	811.9506225585938
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	546.2281494140625
it
was all pride and insolence.	1251.9322509765625
what i have to say relates to
     poor lydia.	999.810302734375
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	578.222412109375
but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	806.44873046875
he placed himself by her.	337.9164733886719
"your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."	684.37255859375
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	966.6629638671875
i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	525.4074096679688
elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	927.0565185546875
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	244.48538208007812
but you do not know _all_.	622.60205078125
when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr. darcy, of pemberley, and lady
anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i
am excessively attentive to all those things.	744.9559936523438
what does he say?	363.17388916015625
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has
too much truth.	667.2382202148438
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	422.971435546875
she added, "by far too much.	268.3638916015625
darcy!--my father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	880.0785522460938
they must have seen them together for ever."	463.4637451171875
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	518.5313110351562
is it true?"	1317.427001953125
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	579.0653686523438
have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	939.359375
but it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."	515.852783203125
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet.	725.50146484375
but i dare not
hope it.	340.9136657714844
she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	1171.9288330078125
when she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	2179.4423828125
elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	572.351806640625
if an
individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are
located in the united states, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg
are removed.	1266.32421875
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	1405.06787109375
mr. darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	983.4933471679688
in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	882.735595703125
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.	429.1214294433594
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the
minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	641.3399658203125
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."	446.5279235839844
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr.
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	667.233154296875
its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	3899.305419921875
to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	426.797119140625
you never see a fault in any body.	659.1754150390625
he heard her with astonishment.	772.9701538085938
he
arranges the business just as he pleases."	821.7617797851562
mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.	538.33251953125
he seldom appeared really
animated.	1892.926513671875
i have no such injuries to resent.	814.5146484375
at present i will
say nothing about it."	382.53466796875
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	887.9434204101562
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	663.2413940429688
we have heard nothing from town."	461.6500244140625
she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	1328.9898681640625
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	1327.778076171875
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"you are mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."	636.8804931640625
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."	454.68572998046875
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_."	666.8800659179688
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	338.995361328125
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	446.2303466796875
there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs. philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	718.065673828125
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.	981.3193359375
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	723.1273193359375
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	957.031005859375
we must not make him desperate."	417.2701416015625
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."	670.0861206054688
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	930.5633544921875
it is impossible that he should still love
me."	308.6009521484375
you shall not defend her,
though it is charlotte lucas.	400.8384094238281
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	626.7393798828125
i had not an idea of it."	245.27508544921875
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr.
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy's
looks and behaviour.	417.34674072265625
mr.
darcy may hug himself."	1060.9190673828125
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	435.9892578125
of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	493.8822937011719
soon after
     you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of london they were.	486.15093994140625
your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."	965.3735961914062
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."	568.6659545898438
darcy?"	390.2454528808594
she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	488.23779296875
you are safe from me."	669.0012817382812
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	613.63671875
"complied with!	368.30633544921875
you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	834.1285400390625
to be sure london was
rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	1230.3096923828125
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	965.51953125
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	691.6748046875
dear me!	613.6361083984375
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	673.11083984375
very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	655.7225952148438
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
i assure you.	635.827880859375
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."	679.5115356445312
at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."	669.07275390625
they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	498.3545837402344
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	532.3932495117188
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	772.5567016601562
shall you like to have such a brother?"	574.77197265625
into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	715.967041015625
"oh!"	832.247314453125
lord!	inf
"does that young lady know mr.	601.319580078125
"yes, and i had heard it before.	197.61764526367188
i dare say mr. bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	670.3372802734375
i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	684.9285888671875
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	850.9019165039062
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."	675.9457397460938
but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	775.0247802734375
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	735.6165771484375
said elizabeth.	851.0508422851562
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."	375.306640625
wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly
sisters.	579.9078979492188
i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	531.2201538085938
on opening the door, she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	712.8575439453125
"and mary king is safe!"	2199.74755859375
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's."	807.3421020507812
when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	631.4549560546875
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr.	778.4373779296875
to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr.	712.7127685546875

wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	472.66558837890625
i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	647.2740478515625
elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	461.3558044433594
but it is of small importance."	425.720458984375
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	435.56475830078125
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	716.1541748046875

report is spread abroad?"	892.9927978515625

include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	997.4370727539062
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i
answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	738.2277221679688
though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was
her, i would not have put up with it.	450.0491943359375
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	745.8626708984375
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	949.5167846679688
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	603.7044677734375
miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	518.37109375
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	499.8048095703125
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr. darcy afterwards discharged.	834.0955200195312
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	1157.39208984375
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	504.6930236816406
she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	760.0764770507812
mrs. bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	613.3245849609375
but i hope you will not mind it: it is
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	467.15484619140625
"no--why should he?	607.64404296875
he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	507.0773010253906
they will have nothing else to
do."	469.2635498046875
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	273.1912841796875
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	503.5841064453125
the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	697.8087158203125
but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	549.8849487304688
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	657.7022705078125
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	503.4100341796875
he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	635.7908935546875
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that i am not to be trifled with.	347.230224609375
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	803.82421875
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"	482.2593688964844
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	643.3961181640625
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	742.246337890625
1.f.5.	inf
she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	929.319091796875
sir william only smiled.	1395.7159423828125
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	1093.15087890625
she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	819.6641845703125
mrs. hurst
thought the same, and added,

"she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	454.86029052734375
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	1041.258544921875
"_you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne
for fifty pounds!	1085.725830078125
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw any thing of it.	512.9528198242188
oh!	inf
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to
wickham.	920.3822021484375
she related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	505.95831298828125
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	1107.04541015625
your's, very
     sincerely,

     "m.	1589.018798828125
and now here's mr. bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	467.11541748046875
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	338.71728515625
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	679.9925537109375
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	638.576416015625
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "oh!	1047.14892578125
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	613.4652709960938
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	923.0865478515625
in three volumes.	3989.339111328125
in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."	815.845947265625
with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	560.0194091796875
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	602.00927734375
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	664.409423828125
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	839.475341796875
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	1996.70703125
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	596.8916015625
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	939.4799194335938
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	723.18212890625
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	347.2684631347656
wickham is safe."	636.054443359375
a report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	1173.5364990234375
lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."	465.05474853515625
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	666.185302734375
mrs. collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure."	445.5669860839844
gardiner."	66.73867797851562
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	917.865234375
she repeated.	196.3885498046875
the supposition did not pain her.	465.7138366699219
i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."	432.70611572265625
lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	1138.165283203125
it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	558.5020141601562
you agree that the foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage.	1379.636962890625
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	703.762451171875
unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	1023.6572875976562
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs. collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	846.6663818359375
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	339.9419860839844
"what, none of you?"	509.1612243652344
she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	729.4788818359375
mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	983.1234130859375
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	634.6583862304688
but i
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	497.5401611328125
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	617.6116943359375
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	371.5057678222656
"his manners are very different from his cousin's."	525.7612915039062
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	382.828125
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	390.41741943359375
day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs.
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	820.391845703125
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	504.39495849609375
1.e.5.	inf
when she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr.
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr. bingley for his sister.	721.4479370117188
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs. long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."	326.4242858886719
he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	404.42822265625
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	1028.8680419921875
but, alas!	14615.5302734375
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	1007.39013671875
mr. darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	440.57843017578125
i have by no means done.	316.071533203125
they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	741.3517456054688
very well.	387.75396728515625
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.	883.3057250976562
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	613.7921142578125
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	745.8751220703125
since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	543.7357177734375
"i should not mind any thing at all."	429.7025146484375
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley.	602.2346801757812
mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	493.74688720703125
she enquired into charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	653.5284423828125
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	502.62786865234375
"i am glad i bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	729.486572265625
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object.	598.2969970703125
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	484.10809326171875
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"	689.1845703125
"i am all astonishment.	660.0838012695312
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	1208.5592041015625
he cannot know what mr.
darcy is."	280.7817077636719
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	743.797119140625
i hope they will not meet at all.	409.2745361328125
he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."	571.400146484375
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	694.7989501953125
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	1080.1494140625
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	551.47412109375
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	638.5904541015625
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	385.7931213378906
she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	818.463623046875
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	844.5829467773438
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"	332.3750305175781
he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	488.8061828613281
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	718.5540771484375
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	785.6943359375
there's for you!	359.83734130859375
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley!	635.7381591796875
mrs. gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	825.2271118164062
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	865.2674560546875
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	315.73321533203125
their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	714.8017578125
brother-in-law of wickham!	275.1141357421875
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	713.4842529296875
mr. darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	341.54107666015625
"undoubtedly.	246.1042938232422
there was no help
for it however.	473.228271484375
i.	inf
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	413.0685119628906
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	411.93829345703125
but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.	461.03143310546875
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property."	597.38134765625

they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."	546.5001220703125
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	1078.2490234375
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley.	942.0040893554688
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week.	836.496826171875
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	445.5799560546875
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	478.9140625
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	341.2646484375
when tea was over, mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	879.6661376953125
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	593.7030029296875
a house in town!	384.55816650390625
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	791.1874389648438
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c. are
sufficiently known.	1618.2777099609375
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	624.5570678710938
his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	821.254150390625
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	620.612548828125
every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	789.9664306640625
on miss lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	245.9638671875
there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	722.4238891601562
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	505.98699951171875
"and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters."	476.0816345214844
"not at all.	327.6301574707031
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."	391.57037353515625
i will go directly to mr. bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	341.082763671875
the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street.	803.59619140625
on this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	664.79443359375
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	423.9364013671875
jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	559.1876831054688
where shall you change
horses?--oh!	1365.84912109375
but, lizzy!	188.08224487304688
the fee is
     owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	887.4359130859375
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	1347.8878173828125
are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	400.8223571777344
"heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me
such an evil."	744.3416748046875
chapter vi.	458.93939208984375
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	620.4862060546875
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	529.091064453125
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, i am sure.	1234.313720703125
stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."	792.6072387695312
chapter xxi.	470.0625915527344
in
understanding darcy was the superior.	472.3278503417969
do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."	748.1566162109375
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	656.6578369140625
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs. nicholls was in
meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	486.2274475097656
"oh!	376.5555419921875
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated
elopement.	891.8961791992188
but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	553.239013671875
good or bad?"	1679.1396484375
remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	607.9472045898438
the promised
letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	730.8963623046875
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	556.0230712890625
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	783.6828002929688
my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	359.1643371582031
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	3240.734375
his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	467.2571105957031
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	691.7645263671875
your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.	292.8126525878906
"did not you?	276.84808349609375
"i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said darcy.	569.547119140625
i
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	287.7665100097656
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all mr. collins's scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	664.3466796875
she saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."	374.27655029296875
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	653.5814208984375
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	587.4765625
bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	825.092529296875
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	509.5852966308594
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	555.1787719726562
"how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet!	430.5270080566406
bingley met them with hopes
that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	627.2760620117188

and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	1021.6170654296875

"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	921.8048095703125
he was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"just as you please."	681.769775390625
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	459.9897155761719
putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	383.1312561035156
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	1421.442626953125

"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	464.83349609375

he had been some time with mr. gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning.	449.48150634765625
he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	3564.685546875
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	464.3600769042969

"what can be the meaning of this!"	329.84698486328125
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"oh!	662.2136840820312
why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"	392.5634765625
she was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr.
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	879.1881103515625
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of
short duration.	492.5262451171875
"but the wife of mr.
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."	549.4569091796875
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."	1120.208740234375
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	1147.1920166015625
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	815.83349609375
in the hall they parted.	1037.933349609375
"then, who taught you?	805.5032958984375
the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr. darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	577.2034912109375
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at pemberley.	986.85693359375
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	662.4136352539062
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"	1149.5181884765625
the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	1789.10107421875
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"you mean to frighten me, mr. darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	432.07171630859375
"but you--how are you?"	259.956787109375
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	333.2914123535156
the
rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	785.2733154296875
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."	637.3082275390625
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	642.161865234375
i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.	506.65093994140625
thus, we do not necessarily

stupider person."	1073.8768310546875
"ah!	175.0257568359375
in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	860.0675659179688
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	766.377197265625
it originated in
mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	759.170166015625
he has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	1187.28662109375
at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	526.5234985351562
no."	57.555992126464844
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	1190.945556640625
"oh!	376.5555419921875
in that case he would return no more.	357.04522705078125
my
father, however, is partial to mr. wickham.	513.8164672851562
she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	719.3638305664062
not a soul knew of it, but col. and mrs.
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	599.921630859375
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	465.40283203125
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	813.2203369140625
her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	713.7398071289062
the first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached
     mr. bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr.	887.728759765625
i dearly love a
laugh."	427.5740051269531
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	1091.7625732421875
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week; and even mr. darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least.	807.14501953125
wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	721.1043701171875
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	804.6356811523438
in this danger kitty
is also comprehended.	2272.92041015625
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	364.57794189453125
his principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	1113.7821044921875
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	637.0579223632812
chapter viii.	605.2932739257812
you must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."	654.9910278320312
"i desire you will do no such thing.	617.8941650390625
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	564.7818603515625
if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long.	416.4426574707031
"you have said quite enough, madam.	419.37115478515625
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have
not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	386.0940246582031
i hope she will turn out well."	371.2569580078125
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	367.5419616699219
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	1809.3076171875
elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	563.26123046875
he added, that mr.
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon.	563.568603515625
she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	1098.367431640625
it will pass away soon enough."	534.7283325195312
only look at her.	171.22576904296875
she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	698.350341796875
she will
make him a very proper wife."	736.3514404296875
chapter xxii.	670.579345703125
let wickham
be _your_ man.	935.67041015625
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	624.4201049804688
in
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	541.6553955078125
a great deal more passed at the
other table.	657.0634155273438
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present.	506.5789489746094
cried mrs. gardiner.	357.3070068359375
"you are joking, lizzy.	474.237548828125
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	261.08251953125
"i have said no such thing.	461.0279235839844
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	1290.3486328125
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr. collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	622.8380737304688
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	717.480712890625
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	366.196533203125
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	640.8465576171875
"oh!	376.5555419921875
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."	959.5387573242188
but i
will not repine.	846.2567138671875
i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	387.4833679199219
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	785.7763671875
to
put me on my guard?	901.8275756835938
lady catherine seemed resigned.	1626.435302734375
"she is so fond of mrs. forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!	406.93060302734375
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	481.98370361328125
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	607.9570922851562
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	410.3041076660156
do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	1420.0517578125
as
for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	613.3871459960938
her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	671.9765014648438
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	535.2433471679688
what
     he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again
     to-morrow evening.	743.623291015625
their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	394.7960205078125
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	305.429443359375
and this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.	1243.0013427734375
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable.	979.8272705078125
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	586.8611450195312
he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other
     person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.	573.802001953125
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	479.52899169921875
to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr. bingley's heart were entertained.	1076.5341796875
it drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	524.0797729492188
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	377.3860168457031
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	568.705810546875
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	856.1015014648438
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	307.1393737792969
you know pretty well, i suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.	561.0794677734375
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	677.7598876953125
"i never heard that it was."	312.5985412597656
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	289.152587890625
i will put on my things in a moment.	590.5709228515625
but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy's
pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr. denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	644.1273193359375
he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	1243.4898681640625
however, i did not hear above one word in ten,
for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	458.17913818359375
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	955.6588745117188
"how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.--_you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	1105.6083984375
the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	891.4182739257812
it may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	826.8814697265625
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	696.6005859375
you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	259.3324279785156
i dare say i shall
soon see them here."	562.1469116210938
she was ashamed to think how
much.	622.2372436523438
i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	573.8521118164062
"not at all."	220.86476135253906
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	1048.291015625
the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	929.2920532226562
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	393.016357421875
i am very glad
you liked her.	654.621337890625
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr. bennet were dead.	629.6029052734375
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	1197.562744140625
mamma would like to
go too of all things!	749.223388671875
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	444.1635437011719
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	521.5874633789062
her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	673.1406860351562
mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger than
mrs. bennet and mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	691.10546875
and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs. long.	467.1363525390625
"and do you really know all this?"	287.2187194824219
"oh!	376.5555419921875
kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do.	653.8164672851562
"la!	188.83657836914062
it must be an amusing study."	925.9251098632812
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	590.746337890625
this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."	693.9307861328125
vol.	inf
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	559.7185668945312
kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.	589.4860229492188
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	2006.6851806640625
dear, dear lizzy.	425.323974609375
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	424.0261535644531
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	490.06597900390625
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	528.747314453125
i speak nothing but the truth.	410.92578125
they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	522.227294921875
mr. gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	452.0213623046875
he knows where we live.	1388.6287841796875
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	443.4575500488281
i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	750.4909057617188
she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	836.8072509765625
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	965.8280639648438
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	902.28955078125
they are all for what they can get.	476.597900390625
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	721.1631469726562
he confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	786.603759765625
"mr. darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	586.4312133789062
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can
dance."	949.1908569335938
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	1085.71240234375
his character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.
darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	669.4700317382812
from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry mr. collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_."	521.4939575195312
you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did.	712.838134765625
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	383.77960205078125
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?"	451.5973815917969
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs. collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	615.7059936523438
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	889.7879638671875
i
did not expect such a compliment."	488.0997619628906
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	1254.320556640625
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	901.9053955078125
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	864.1945190429688
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs. bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	804.08642578125
"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	673.2732543945312
"that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever
heard you utter.	495.4454345703125
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	491.8268737792969
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	704.1165771484375
this must be the grossest falsehood!"	1448.1419677734375
vol.	inf
"your first position is false.	1555.6815185546875
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	713.6278686523438
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	521.233154296875
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs. hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	660.6666870117188
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away;
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	536.3424682617188
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	726.697998046875
your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	1438.28515625
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	515.2195434570312
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	492.6406555175781
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	919.68603515625
we neither of us perform to strangers."	776.1956787109375
where is your sash my dear?"	658.7056884765625
it was to this effect:

     "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	868.842041015625
mr.	inf
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	669.1793212890625
"and quite alone?	1167.13671875
chapter xii.	258.2942810058594
"she did indeed, louisa.	2623.25048828125
"you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	2338.8046875
collins."	53.41938781738281
"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	360.9765625
it was over at last however.	634.9755859375
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	565.4674072265625
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	627.39453125
yes--i understand you perfectly."	397.90875244140625
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr. darcy's proposals.	556.0973510742188
mr. darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	509.2933349609375
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	1298.4180908203125
his circumstances, he
     assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.	499.63922119140625
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	674.85107421875
one must speak a little, you know.	288.4139404296875
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	1517.9031982421875
but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley's chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	664.2012939453125
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	441.63916015625
"and pray
may i ask?"	1146.27392578125
but he is a
liberal master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."	633.0078735351562
she shook her head.	465.273681640625
elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	498.00799560546875
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	345.340576171875
"true.	556.144287109375
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs. gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	886.1162109375
he does not
want abilities.	1141.27978515625
"perhaps we might be deceived."	333.14349365234375
how can they suit each other?--do you
know mr.	682.2120971679688
"how could
you begin?"	877.0291748046875
how is half such a sum to be
repaid?"	923.5352172851562
if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	477.09063720703125
mr. collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	617.4161987304688
she cried.	246.044921875
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	380.85858154296875
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	601.9926147460938
let us hope for
better things.	623.1327514648438
"good heaven!	1895.50537109375
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	579.9236450195312
charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	610.37060546875
her report was highly favourable.	1020.6329956054688
yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	536.0980224609375
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	519.6674194335938
but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	801.10595703125
miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	1043.08984375
it was agreed to.	748.8990478515625
--and
upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr.	1121.3363037109375
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	605.9360961914062
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	735.3931274414062
my uncle!"	372.55670166015625
it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr. collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	555.2108154296875
have you had any
flirting?	857.52001953125
mrs. bennet's best
comfort was, that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.	528.4874267578125
"the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	1034.447021484375
he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	859.9535522460938
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy.	394.05462646484375
well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	816.225341796875
and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	630.2715454101562
such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	666.0204467773438
i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."	1166.420654296875
jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	924.3436279296875
"oh!	376.5555419921875
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	719.962646484375
elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	660.8302001953125
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	352.5106506347656
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	837.6591796875
i do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	627.1558227539062
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	570.4513549804688
"oh!	376.5555419921875
unfeeling, selfish girl!	7938.44091796875
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr. collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	791.18896484375
chapter xxiii.	399.6881103515625
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	337.13604736328125
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	370.3442687988281
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	640.4854736328125
she dared not
even mention that gentleman.	710.458740234375
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	533.65185546875
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	402.5675048828125
darcy said very
little, and mr. hurst nothing at all.	361.19903564453125
he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	552.1898193359375
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"	304.76458740234375
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report?	473.24066162109375
"what should not you mind?"	435.615234375
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	457.25372314453125
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs. hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london.	356.7785339355469
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	1207.43994140625
the first week of their return was soon gone.	545.5399169921875
the idea of mr. collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	743.501708984375
had the late mr. darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	1065.82275390625
elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	855.3580322265625
in
truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	781.0009765625
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	463.6573791503906
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	1024.5772705078125
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)	879.6015625
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	570.881591796875
"yes, almost every day."	391.05035400390625
my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	756.7789916992188
but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	705.2412109375
but she would not be secure.	659.679443359375
mrs. bennet could hardly
contain herself.	1061.4979248046875
the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	564.4329833984375
u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.	3724.1015625
her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	3286.6240234375
i guessed as much."	332.507568359375
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton.	643.8150634765625
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs. collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	465.3227233886719
"you are then resolved to have him?"	427.18804931640625
"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short
silence.	633.2862548828125
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	925.251220703125
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	1488.41796875
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	354.9156188964844
"i have no right to give _my_ opinion," said wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	404.0157470703125
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	1359.698486328125
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	2812.00439453125
i expected
you to stay two months.	638.955322265625
elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	869.6175537109375
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	815.77978515625
mrs. long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	357.7720947265625
mr. bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. mrs. bennet was quite
disconcerted.	742.998779296875
her colour
changed, and she said no more.	371.5149841308594
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	532.960693359375
she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr. darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	863.6635131835938
but however he did not.	229.91700744628906
nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	1420.706787109375
they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	828.965576171875
one day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	586.1524658203125
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	941.1047973632812
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	670.2535400390625
"you need not distress yourself.	1409.032470703125
mamma, do the
people here abouts know i am married to-day?	842.7589721679688
"he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."	585.880859375
but your
_family_ owe me nothing.	1783.86376953125
said miss bingley; "will
she be as tall as i am?"	583.215087890625
she has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?	614.5728759765625
yes.	inf
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	385.43292236328125
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	947.08447265625
there was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	1398.112548828125
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	418.9939880371094
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	1677.50146484375
but is it
certain, absolutely certain?"	1221.8150634765625
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	549.4605712890625
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	327.6234130859375
let me hear
     from you very soon.	469.31500244140625
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	634.3942260742188
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	896.5250854492188
you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say.	547.4933471679688
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife?"	894.0447998046875
mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	542.4300537109375
she was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr.
darcy, she was directly retreating.	697.9262084960938
they were hopeless of remedy.	2320.93701171875
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	910.6585083007812
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	637.051513671875
they have at
least that advantage."	441.61181640625
i knew it myself, as
     it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.	539.6803588867188
kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	992.7296142578125
she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs.
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	554.6304931640625
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	1118.293212890625
and poor mr. darcy!	363.1790771484375
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	600.0386962890625
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	534.1353149414062
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned.	363.9130554199219
and when i returned home, the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	463.94354248046875
"oh!	376.5555419921875
if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him.	450.02685546875
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	372.89239501953125
well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	859.9937133789062
"i have, sir."	309.8915100097656
however, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a project gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"plain vanilla ascii" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official project gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "plain vanilla ascii" or other
form.	1382.8648681640625
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr. bennet
came from it.	387.2052001953125
she was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	934.982666015625
"oh, lizzy!	244.79638671875
at least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."	589.566162109375
"you write uncommonly fast."	1478.3519287109375
yes, i call it a _very_ easy distance."	1372.091552734375
he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."	520.1568603515625
everything wore
a happier aspect.	2621.83984375
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	555.2949829101562
he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr. darcy.	597.9681396484375
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	621.1158447265625
"ah!"	323.98150634765625
could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	627.3146362304688
to all the
objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	696.0039672851562
it is admirable!"	1759.1234130859375
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs. gardiner.	397.75946044921875
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	2361.6494140625
elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	635.32421875
"and my mother--how is she?	387.93927001953125
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr. collins
very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	444.6225280761719
colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	717.80615234375
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	657.2545776367188
his surprise was great.	505.00091552734375
the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	1499.4180908203125
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs. hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."	756.7093505859375
in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	1280.581298828125
"what could he mean?	415.01220703125
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.	548.928466796875
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	365.64654541015625
having said thus much, i feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.	674.6734619140625
when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	358.2924499511719
she was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.	403.6185302734375
darcy.--_i_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."	546.6961059570312
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	334.8612976074219
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	514.0134887695312
"yes, or i will never see her again."	197.17750549316406
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	564.1092529296875
after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	632.6460571289062
"if one could but go to brighton!"	565.9119262695312
i am the happiest creature in
     the world.	1142.3197021484375
at present i am not in love with
mr. wickham; no, i certainly am not.	461.4689025878906
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as mr. gardiner could do.	744.042236328125
in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	911.304443359375
"yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	1133.60205078125
"what do you mean, mr. bennet, by talking in this way?	382.5768127441406
lydia came to
     us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	577.6241455078125
indeed, mr. darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	547.9872436523438
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	1335.151123046875
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell,
you will be attended to."	634.4069213867188

mother.	691.2366333007812

in the evening, soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr. darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	584.2117919921875
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	463.39300537109375
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	503.72772216796875
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.	799.3480224609375
i always said it must be so, at last.	342.4110412597656
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	721.3103637695312
i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr. darcy.	465.1461181640625
darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented.	826.9930419921875
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	685.7291870117188
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	1004.7171020507812
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	781.9761352539062
i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	583.43505859375
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	862.6514282226562
elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	827.7059326171875
i shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	596.8905029296875
dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	893.07373046875
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	531.282958984375
darcy!"	956.6610107421875
"what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	371.1514892578125
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	472.7776184082031
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	702.7249145507812
"it is well.	280.0599060058594
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	611.7911376953125
you must not suspect me.	1114.137939453125
i must confess myself
     surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.	777.8786010742188
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	531.5346069335938
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton."	495.1121826171875
you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	811.93359375
this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	361.8910217285156
i know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.	705.3861694335938
the
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	606.8460693359375
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	515.8292236328125
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	937.6548461914062
--

"my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	489.80596923828125
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him."	507.5882263183594
"and men take care that they should."	567.6640625
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	1072.627685546875
i
     must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	706.0228271484375
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs.
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	514.0698852539062
yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again.	541.5614013671875
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	823.4712524414062
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	469.3403015136719
no look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	913.7529296875
she smiled, but made no answer.	376.1046142578125
i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	806.0957641601562
not these two or three years perhaps."	464.5899658203125
oh!	inf
it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to mr. darcy.	575.9747314453125

bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	1167.61328125
the carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	354.83050537109375
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	1952.785400390625
mr. gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	759.2161865234375
"oh!	376.5555419921875
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same;
and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet.	1054.61328125
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	328.54425048828125
"and this is your real opinion!	518.5792846679688

_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	388.15985107421875

"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."	619.3442993164062
it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."	354.71917724609375
well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	1185.9998779296875
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	1529.27001953125
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	364.35321044921875
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	492.8095703125
"well, so much the better.	154.051025390625
with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"	734.9454345703125
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	872.89208984375
this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	440.6292724609375
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	429.80908203125
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner
thought of him, and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	473.8273010253906
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	641.5892333984375
if there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	816.470947265625
the path just admitted three.	1266.855712890625
mr. gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	1159.710693359375
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!	372.65191650390625
"oh, jane,
take care."	453.25701904296875
i have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	909.8841552734375
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable."	423.36895751953125
chapter xiii.	578.345947265625
she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	447.3443603515625
she got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	585.7926025390625
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what
i learnt, to my own family!	546.1624755859375
"aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	613.2058715820312
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	818.8024291992188
but, however, he is very welcome to
come to netherfield, if he likes it.	296.9154968261719
mr.
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	751.999755859375
it is highly improper.	2654.5537109375
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	854.13330078125
if i had ever learnt, i
should have been a great proficient.	629.9696044921875
make haste, make haste.	3094.9619140625
mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	793.170166015625
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	635.70751953125
to persuade him against
     returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.	742.602783203125
"very, very much.	431.4779357910156
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	533.0829467773438
there is
one point, on which i want your advice.	437.83074951171875
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	395.3921203613281
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	794.5033569335938
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	704.2310791015625
"mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	1004.4454956054688
what a contrast between him and his friend!	849.3671875
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."	499.8791809082031
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	437.7259521484375
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	1119.2593994140625

but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much.	421.0175476074219
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	940.1763305664062
i have not _that_ pain.	847.588623046875

feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	707.7833862304688
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	1310.719970703125
mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	882.1612548828125
i will take care of
myself, and of mr. wickham too.	268.9911193847656
"oh!"	832.247314453125
it
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	656.2449340820312
but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance."	624.0358276367188

project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!	697.7258911132812
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr.	569.9597778320312

something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	551.283203125
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"jane, i congratulate you.	486.290283203125
what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr. bingley--is not he?	464.915283203125
my sweetest lizzy!	347.7274475097656
"yes, all of them, i think.	143.24217224121094
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with."	262.9111022949219
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	363.3543701171875

i roused, and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_.	732.6630249023438
it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	611.427734375

called on us in this familiar way."	423.3311767578125

is she handsome?"	638.4342651367188
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	281.20257568359375
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	799.3346557617188
it gives me pain
to speak ill of a darcy.	690.214599609375
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	871.6056518554688

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.	1940.12744140625
but in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.	668.7161254882812
"as often as i can.	403.285888671875
miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	972.23974609375
cried lydia.	347.88385009765625
such a charming man!--so handsome!	782.8935546875
oh, lizzy!	190.1597900390625
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough.	686.9263305664062
a few weeks, he believed.	470.74090576171875
_i_ did for you.	279.17791748046875
but mr. bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	965.2603759765625
he danced
only four dances!	1107.1055908203125
"if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside," cried bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	744.1944580078125
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	477.004638671875
the next was in these words.	443.9632263183594
but here he was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	501.6203308105469
with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	1155.2681884765625
"oh!	376.5555419921875
her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	373.6964416503906

long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	597.6936645507812
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	671.594970703125
"you have.	225.63650512695312
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	614.3138427734375
he had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."	597.9430541992188
their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	1897.407958984375
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	982.197998046875
and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,

"dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr.	622.1707763671875
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	1262.6070556640625

"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	507.8785095214844
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.	558.7772216796875
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	186.85980224609375
she had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	506.5224304199219
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	706.3787841796875
i must conclude, for i cannot be
     long from my poor mother.	460.05419921875
_i_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	624.102783203125
she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	1481.5205078125
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	796.2965698242188
an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	659.9283447265625
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	741.2467651367188
reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	802.3292236328125
"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	467.58074951171875
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	658.46484375
she wrote even
to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	843.1090087890625

been always at longbourn."	313.0023193359375

mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--mr.	1105.737060546875
if, indeed, it should be so!	251.02923583984375
human nature is so prone to
fall into it!	1004.7386474609375
collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	868.8971557617188
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	975.1829833984375
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr.	489.2727966308594
she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	447.674072265625
"i do not recollect that we did."	360.490966796875
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	1143.7144775390625
to these high
flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	623.2950439453125
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	536.3040771484375
her ease and good
spirits increased.	641.9442138671875
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy.	489.507568359375
it was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	3032.2822265625
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	690.743408203125
oh!	inf
do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	912.9498291015625
i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.	1135.0418701171875
he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	604.3827514648438
but i confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	759.0137939453125
well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr. stone.	630.0089721679688
it was first broken by mrs. annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs. gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	1093.81982421875
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	528.9306640625
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by
character perfectly well.	597.0222778320312
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	749.5267333984375

"_i_ never saw such a woman.	584.9661254882812
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	617.1874389648438
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	843.0366821289062
he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	557.1465454101562
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession
to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	363.04974365234375
i
never was.	247.091552734375
yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember."	351.1405334472656
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united

"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	688.308349609375
mr. bennet treated the matter differently.	2800.603271484375
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	888.8855590820312
"oh!	376.5555419921875
the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	519.4127807617188
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	443.5045166015625
till this moment, i never knew myself."	318.67022705078125
if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	538.6388549804688
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	816.1536865234375
what shall we do with him?	423.4111328125
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	777.1378173828125
such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	1206.6019287109375
mr. wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.	925.5825805664062
i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield.	442.64862060546875
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	496.9158935546875
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,

"miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master.	413.33685302734375
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?"	335.901123046875
there is nothing else to be done.	528.1095581054688
the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	807.215087890625
"already arisen!"	2973.28076171875
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."	431.57855224609375
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	637.5791015625
women fancy admiration means more than
it does."	564.0648803710938
i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance.	435.7190856933594
the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year.	790.2855224609375
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	687.07080078125
in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	942.832275390625
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	790.2244873046875
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "ah!	706.50439453125
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	278.0180358886719
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	736.615478515625
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	1061.273681640625
thought elizabeth.	1098.769775390625
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."	396.19476318359375
i told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	1308.9024658203125
but,
my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	586.843505859375
but his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	983.3494262695312
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	483.50067138671875
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	514.0914306640625
"_that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."	809.9066162109375
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	697.4541015625
"oh!	376.5555419921875
mr. darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"this walk is not wide enough for our party.	691.2666015625
so much the better.	228.3917236328125
"i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."	684.0316162109375
"what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	391.23370361328125

towards _him_; they are even impartial towards miss king.	1541.2803955078125

they could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for mr. darcy.	580.818359375
you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	1026.65283203125
"and that," said mrs. reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	562.5730590820312
he takes them now for people of
fashion."	801.7051391601562
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	394.4386901855469
a low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	827.665283203125
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	313.4378356933594
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor."	1298.728271484375
its completion depended on others.	1142.82421875
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_
a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	780.9182739257812
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	985.8724975585938

had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	693.0557861328125
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	393.3138732910156
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	430.5682678222656
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	352.1014404296875
he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure
_i_ never want to see him again.	322.03326416015625
*       *       *       *       *

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs. bennet's curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	563.18017578125
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	698.7490234375
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	919.0718383789062
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	509.7048645019531
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	401.3902282714844
he still loves me, and we are
engaged."	335.8524169921875
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	602.2389526367188
she could
think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent.	389.16802978515625
he is gone to my father already.	586.4395751953125
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr. darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	935.0629272460938
my dear brother," replied mrs. bennet, "that is exactly what i
could most wish for.	299.67706298828125
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	627.2183227539062
as a
child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
temper.	989.0498657226562
you shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	1149.3680419921875
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	939.5161743164062
it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	719.5319213867188
"there can be no doubt of that.	328.57684326171875
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	1000.5061645507812
i am
going away myself."	612.2726440429688
collins!"	838.4595947265625
but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	1773.7423095703125

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	439.54791259765625
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	399.0499572753906
as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	662.157470703125
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	519.10107421875
my feelings will not be
repressed.	962.8102416992188
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	438.3753662109375
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	502.3779602050781
"can you deny that you have done it?"	519.0054931640625
"are you, indeed?	175.36326599121094
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!	650.2279663085938
having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	1139.9598388671875
"most willingly."	811.2756958007812
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	1066.618896484375
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs. bennet, "and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	380.881103515625
but, lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or jane at most.	404.20843505859375
"good heaven!	1895.50537109375
mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	1153.67333984375
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	528.4302368164062
it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	573.3051147460938
in the absence of jane,
he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	455.682861328125
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied darcy.	859.8666381835938
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	458.88885498046875
their powers of conversation were considerable.	1310.31689453125
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	1007.3612670898438
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	1306.643798828125
and his sisters are charming women.	1502.694091796875
though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was."	479.3614196777344
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	448.0576171875
i was afraid they might
not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was
determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like
any thing."	568.5984497070312
the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	838.8035278320312
he was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	1484.0389404296875
it cannot be concealed from any one.	631.6061401367188
elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	393.1235656738281
_that_ is all to be forgot.	661.4190673828125
not a syllable was uttered by either; and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	608.6688842773438
"indeed, mr. collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	601.3006591796875
that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr. darcy!	578.224365234375
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	624.1873168945312
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."	673.6602172851562
it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	917.1910400390625
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	1272.338134765625
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	924.603271484375
he had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.	603.0289306640625
and then we were so merry all the way home!	673.4832153320312
miss lucas is married and settled.	552.7760009765625
for god's sake, say no more of
his partners.	756.1542358398438
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	298.464599609375
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	1031.3140869140625
perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	621.01220703125
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	582.86279296875
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	510.0428161621094
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	1018.2869873046875
james's?"	778.6022338867188
were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me.	389.6905822753906
but it must not, shall not be.	317.0841369628906
and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	1023.1380615234375
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	1483.38671875
change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."	864.0733642578125
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	537.7963256835938
your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.'	770.3760375976562
within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	551.2109375
they
are my old friends.	1318.407470703125
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	707.327880859375
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	300.13153076171875
i shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance i require."	463.86700439453125
as long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	420.74261474609375
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	1082.5863037109375
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	733.560791015625
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
every thing will be well."	380.54144287109375
they are gone down to
newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, i do not know how long.	483.70635986328125
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament.	1306.1903076171875
she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	501.74688720703125
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	223.79722595214844
"i cannot make him
out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	560.440185546875
"mr. collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	583.0771484375
though lydia's short
     letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to
     gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief
     that w. never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which
     was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from b. intending to trace their route.	1194.655029296875
but, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	510.9642028808594
his fear of her, has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart."	503.4767761230469
they then went away.	922.9800415039062
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	960.026611328125
on the following monday, mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn.	636.2958984375
heaven forbid!	272.24224853515625
i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	892.03955078125
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	754.5687255859375
i _will_ leave him to himself."	343.54425048828125
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	607.67822265625
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	485.2419128417969
to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?	1471.4835205078125
younger sons cannot marry
where they like."	407.1912841796875
mrs. reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	1196.64306640625
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	578.626220703125
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	640.7738037109375
but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	810.4134521484375
i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	510.29388427734375
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr. bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	553.67529296875
i am sure you must feel it
so."	311.54248046875
how can it affect them?"	934.4678955078125
the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	556.804443359375
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	565.5084228515625
mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	523.0115356445312
the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	2876.799560546875
the
adieu is charity itself.	2522.339111328125
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	684.322998046875
but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	877.92626953125
i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	434.3404541015625
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	558.5313110351562
with _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!	852.8338623046875
you must not disappoint your father."	548.4679565429688
who attended to you?	378.41656494140625
such a countenance, such manners!	630.7105102539062
the
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	518.0795288085938
pray read on."	145.8203887939453
but no
such recollection befriended her.	1244.8145751953125
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	253.59112548828125
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	559.6219482421875
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when
he put his letter into her hand!	912.8449096679688
"well, lizzy," said mrs. bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane's?	494.90093994140625
collins must excuse
me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	617.2987060546875
i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	511.0575256347656
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	174.70748901367188
pray forgive
     me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far, as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
     have been all round the park.	542.7407836914062
her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her
poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their
charms.	768.8776245117188
"but it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded.	451.075927734375
he had rather hoped that all his wife's
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.	635.5872192382812
it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.	616.9443969726562
i do not believe she often sees such at home."	532.3447265625
you have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert.	848.1263427734375
about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire, to which he belonged.	593.3812255859375
elizabeth looked surprised.	1063.4124755859375
mr. bennet's expectations were fully answered.	1891.994384765625
"they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them."	524.0208129882812
that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of
his sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling.	890.4611206054688
to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and
whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what jane felt for bingley.	449.51641845703125
she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
lucas has been very kind; she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us."	560.1577758789062
the period of expectation was now doubled.	913.3120727539062
repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.	1056.9627685546875
no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr. darcy.	739.7933959960938
bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening mrs. bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter.	512.866943359375
you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."	315.4647521972656
have you never
happened to see her there?"	495.9713439941406
will you tell
me how long you have loved him?"	837.0287475585938
their table was superlatively stupid.	3664.889404296875
"will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again?--at
present i have not room to do them justice."	684.5321655273438
his accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	463.2447814941406
chapter iii.	787.6764526367188
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for a few minutes to take
leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.--elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	672.962890625
how i wanted you!"	562.9387817382812
the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable
to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with admiration
of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of rosings.	788.7265625
it cannot be.	261.00048828125
what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been gladly and gratefully received!	738.5252685546875
i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?"	337.19183349609375
said jane.	987.7640991210938
chapter xviii.	455.8221435546875
and _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."	481.0308837890625
elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves.	761.415771484375
what could your ladyship propose by it?"	1070.91357421875
are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy?	1109.51025390625
"are you not diverted?"	784.6198120117188
jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	1092.1510009765625
