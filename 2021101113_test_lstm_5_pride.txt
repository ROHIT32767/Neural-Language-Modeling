she was now in an irritation as violent from
delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	5877.32421875
he never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of
listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in
being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of mr.
and mrs. collins's happiness; and that in speaking of rosings and her
not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever
she came into kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	5519.75048828125
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	5285.4541015625
said he,
as he joined her.	5385.11767578125
"do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"	5414.60986328125
"i am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	5091.3359375
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.	5761.70654296875
it was then disclosed in the following
manner.	4871.59912109375
as all
conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.	5357.15478515625
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	5613.9345703125
will you come and see me?"	5742.0302734375
neither could
any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach."	5410.2021484375
if i have wounded your sister's
     feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
     governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have
     not yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more
     weighty accusation, of having injured mr. wickham, i can only
     refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my
     family.	5621.45068359375
"this is
wholly unexpected.	5783.97021484375
is this to be endured!	6206.6552734375
"yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it, not doing its office."	5760.580078125
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	4857.0283203125
"hate you!	5823.0556640625
we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!	5719.955078125
in
that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	5740.4150390625
a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr. bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and mrs. bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter.	5818.126953125
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."	5437.927734375
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.
bennet coolly observed,

"from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.	5626.6748046875
not that i am afraid
of _myself_, but i dread other people's remarks."	5227.32568359375
"i would not be so fastidious as you are," cried bingley, "for a
kingdom!	6176.79443359375
i thought him very sly;--he hardly ever
     mentioned your name.	5231.11572265625
she has two nieces
of her own.	5365.0595703125
"after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	5492.5341796875
"i cannot pretend to be sorry," said wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen.	5836.8779296875
my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know how much i suffer from what she
says.	5812.73046875
she looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singing all night.	5327.6806640625
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.	5501.01611328125
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	5537.21240234375
"you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age."	4774.03564453125
i shall go distracted."	5581.90283203125
"pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried mr. collins; "but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	5273.47119140625
"a gamester!"	5656.03369140625
mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.	4885.49169921875
consider how important every moment is, in such a case."	5387.21875
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand.	5709.6923828125
they were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something!	6058.96533203125
and do you
really love him quite well enough?	5464.03466796875
"by all means," cried bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of.	5559.68505859375
we all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	5571.5849609375
she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage.	4155.30029296875
i write rather slowly."	5788.05908203125
a clear ten
thousand per annum.	5015.328125
her
heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	5771.40185546875
believe her to be deceived by all means.	6231.880859375
hear me in silence.	5427.7783203125
"do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"	5660.517578125
it was not all settled before monday: as soon
     as it was, the express was sent off to longbourn.	5852.1220703125
it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.	5446.3671875
she explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.	6309.79150390625
their reception at home was most kind.	5854.7177734375
"colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	5091.6416015625
"i should imagine not."	5678.03515625
if
he no longer cares for me, why silent?	5250.1826171875
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	5344.5556640625
i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them."	5669.14013671875
"you forget that i have made no
answer.	4813.40625
it was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	6388.2802734375
mr. bingley followed his advice.	5605.67919921875
they were to be off as soon as possible.	5251.4345703125
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication.	5745.19091796875
he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.	6382.92724609375
he bore it however with admirable calmness.	5277.259765625
we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.	5305.189453125
no one but mrs. bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home.	5556.7646484375
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.	5351.8544921875
"there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.	5393.9580078125
"and what did she say?"	5506.916015625
gardiner."	5180.75830078125
allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	5337.77587890625
his behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured.	5462.94580078125
"why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."	5199.86962890625
but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the
world."	6049.640625
but the person who advanced, was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name.	5732.76123046875
a single man of large fortune; four
or five thousand a year.	6129.9541015625
perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now.	5737.6728515625
i am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     hunsford.	5421.9267578125
"my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally i assure you.	5598.4189453125
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up
stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	4743.18994140625
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	5248.35009765625
"_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it."	5908.9599609375
"we were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	5681.138671875
the
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	5463.35205078125
it was an
encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it.	5582.0625
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all.	5594.751953125
it amazes
me, i confess;--for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.	5860.44921875
her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	5237.89453125
"very well.--that reply will do for the present.--perhaps by and bye i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones.--but _now_ we may be silent."	5629.52490234375
to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.	5408.7109375
all was joy and
kindness.	5192.654296875
by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	5595.69140625
i
     thought too ill of him, to invite him to pemberley, or admit his
     society in town.	5582.8505859375
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them.	5454.10107421875
it cannot last long.	5471.28759765625
"that is to say, you had given your permission.	5309.80078125
"if we make haste," said lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes."	5283.29736328125
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away.	5259.3984375
these are conditions, which,
     considering every thing, i had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as i thought myself privileged, for you.	5302.013671875
she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr. collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings.	5455.9794921875
oh, brother,
how kind you are!	5098.2548828125
"i hope," added mrs. gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.	5666.40478515625
i know how much
you dislike him."	5389.9521484375
"i have heard much of your master's fine person," said mrs. gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	5487.71728515625
i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together."	5431.43359375
end of vol.	5410.32568359375
one ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!	6114.5517578125
philips.--the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.	5457.8525390625
1.e.	5589.37646484375
my mother was in hysterics, and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done!	5454.2939453125
"you are not going to introduce yourself to mr.	5585.68359375
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,

"i hope mr. bingley will like it lizzy."	5542.8759765625
mrs. bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous
conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	5254.58544921875
his most particular
friend, you see by jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her.	5430.31494140625
it was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up.	5601.666015625
we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world; a sense of
very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	5502.794921875
one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself.	5001.77734375
it was
generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
_her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.	5796.85888671875
we talked and laughed so
loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!"	5555.646484375
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.	5285.2578125
he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	4788.77783203125
his character was decided.	5660.0966796875
they were not the only objects of mr. collins's admiration.	6091.86328125
the invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine's drawing-room.	5558.08935546875
"your humility, mr. bingley," said elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."	5368.083984375
"i began to be afraid you would never come back again.	4826.83837890625
chapter xiii.	5819.6416015625
"i do not get on at all.	5419.4921875
this idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them.	5403.23583984375
"i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two.	5519.80810546875
we acted with the best intentions."	6402.7783203125
i cannot
acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should
omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
with the family."	5879.2470703125
after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows,
to admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its
beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much
better worth looking at in the summer.	5620.8720703125
1.e.6.	5765.34521484375
do you not consider that a connection with you,
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"	5266.53564453125
he looked serious as usual; and
she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at pemberley.	5102.92919921875
but i am at his disposal.	5706.41015625
jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	5417.3369140625
in as short a time as mr. collins's long speeches would allow, every
thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be
waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness.	5773.2900390625
"i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but i always speak
what i think."	5441.533203125
"my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"	5269.982421875
there he had talked to her
friends, when he could not to herself.	4555.0517578125
he
comes down on thursday at the latest, very likely on wednesday.	5809.1728515625
said her mother.	5403.23583984375
far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	5749.2138671875
what
could be more natural than his asking you again?	5847.904296875
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	5562.9736328125
i am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy's
regard."	5497.318359375
i know no harm of her."	5048.2568359375
chapter xi.	5451.142578125
"it is no such thing.	6209.37890625
there is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, i dare say."	5593.802734375
wickham
will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here,
what he really is.	6080.1103515625
mrs.
bennet's eyes sparkled.--"a gentleman and a stranger!	5231.5146484375
i am
perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any
design of engaging my affection.	5841.41064453125
"dear lizzy!"	5732.06689453125
"i have no reason, i assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception.	5569.88525390625
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of lady
catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	5688.2841796875
if i could but see _you_ as happy!	5714.82958984375
"my object _then_," replied darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to.	5320.181640625
but in such cases as these,
a good memory is unpardonable.	5512.3857421875
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.	5553.3369140625
for
my part, mr. bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	5483.34912109375
"i can much more easily believe mr. bingley's being imposed on, than
that mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--if it
be not so, let mr. darcy contradict it.	5109.703125
when first mr. bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	5065.87451171875
ever since i have known it, i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it.	5696.4873046875
it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	5494.5986328125
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	5991.380859375
mr. darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand; but in vain.	5845.26123046875
i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."	5485.681640625
i do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
     be deceived again.	5582.51513671875
"there _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	5071.8056640625
as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, mr. darcy, and mr.
darcy only, entered the room.	5947.6025390625
not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr. gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power.--elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily
settled.	5522.85693359375
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance.	5664.74609375
who
are your uncles and aunts?	5039.79052734375
"are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?"	5682.54248046875
it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner.	5441.595703125
"it may do very well for the others," replied mr. bingley; "but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty.	5174.650390625
she really
looked almost wild."	5721.19921875
you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother's permission for this address.	5668.8427734375
she shall hear my opinion."	5224.3154296875
"he is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	5808.53515625
presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	5227.490234375
bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	5938.9130859375
"the country," said darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.	5757.9052734375
wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."	5274.7939453125
his plan did not vary on seeing them.--miss bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.	5786.71240234375
charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley."	5079.017578125
how are you all?"	5773.90673828125
his choice is disinterested at least,
     for he must know my father can give her nothing.	5207.4873046875
he is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse any thing, which he
condescended to ask.	6123.75439453125
"i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"	5863.56298828125
"i must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	5889.5615234375
lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr.
collins first came to hunsford."	5965.19482421875
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling."	6200.1357421875
mr. bingley and jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.	5434.95703125
he shook his head.--"i wish i could call her amiable.	5616.66015625
his character is thereby complete."	5347.3291015625
it needed all
jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.	5140.77001953125
it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	5562.3369140625
does he
know his real character?"	4850.94580078125
lady catherine's great attentions to mrs. collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.	5382.6220703125
but do not be cast down.	5187.7890625
"and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.	5705.1259765625
he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.	5851.2626953125
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	5408.2724609375
"oh, no!"	5346.7578125
those who do not complain are never
pitied."	5264.8984375
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	5726.13330078125
without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.	6071.96875
he made no answer.	5123.9716796875

project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.	5217.26513671875
lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane's beauty.	6124.94580078125
she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country."	5256.826171875
i was
     sometimes quite provoked, but then i recollected my dear elizabeth
     and jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	5529.68212890625
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its
cookery was owing.	4956.1748046875
how much you
must have gone through!"	5216.9765625
then, the two third he danced with miss
king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----"

"if he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much!	5606.40625
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the project gutenberg-tm
collection.	4996.37548828125
but every body is to
judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i
assure you.	5319.7705078125
"all young ladies accomplished!	5165.0703125
"you must decide for yourself," said elizabeth, "and if upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you by
all means to refuse him."	5843.99609375
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "mr. bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"	4897.48974609375
she could think only of her letter.	5402.30322265625
"of mr. collins and lizzy.	6353.39990234375
though i
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you."	5311.9228515625
chapter iv.	5525.60693359375
"no, not at all."	5960.8671875
bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.	4769.76220703125
he
cannot afford it.	5310.27685546875
mr.	5923.5673828125
elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	5321.3388671875
mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can
     spare from me.	5186.93310546875
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	5605.962890625
the girls stared at their father.	5852.79736328125
"oh, well!	5574.99755859375
the motive professed, was his conviction of its being
     owing to himself that wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
     known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,
     to love or confide in him.	5067.89892578125
"i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more."	6519.1318359375
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster,
the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
to be described.	5640.6220703125
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.	5651.7470703125
"oh!	5569.869140625
"let me be rightly understood.	5330.32861328125
"but i was embarrassed."	5470.59375
she had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.	5690.6337890625
"insolent girl!"	5592.708984375
she cried: "this is delightful indeed!--she will
be married!--i shall see her again!--she will be married at sixteen!--my
good, kind brother!--i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
every thing.	5675.35009765625
it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	5745.44287109375
they have some of the finest woods in the
country."	6089.92333984375
"has she been presented?	5652.88427734375
they battled it
     together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman
     or lady concerned in it deserved.	5321.9833984375
"and can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"	5525.427734375
"will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"	4780.51416015625
i have written to colonel forster, to inform him of
     our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the
     various creditors of mr. wickham in and near brighton, with
     assurances of speedy payment, for which i have pledged myself.	5191.34716796875
elizabeth smiled.	5538.744140625
howsoever that may be, you
     are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion i am not only joined
     by mrs. collins, but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter,
     to whom i have related the affair.	5830.7080078125
_his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a
while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,

"what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam?	5211.96875
cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "i will not detain you a minute,
but let me, or let the servant, go after mr. and mrs. gardiner.	5552.8017578125
as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	5767.25341796875
"how nicely we are crammed in!"	5839.60595703125
i was never more annoyed!	6088.2158203125
i am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	5189.208984375
his pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by.	5898.515625
we are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the
more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that
when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in
achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
dare say it would succeed, if miss de bourgh were out of the way.	5031.271484375
"you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate."	5381.30322265625
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with kitty.	5614.892578125
"oh!	5639.654296875
ignorant as you previously were of every thing
     concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
     suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	6115.7001953125
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.	5212.43115234375
this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."	5730.71142578125
"may we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"	5368.81103515625
"but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham."	5516.240234375
the two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification.	5315.794921875
"what would she have said?--how
would she have behaved?"	5851.2958984375
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.	6099.6357421875
yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	5636.28271484375
"my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now."	5182.49267578125
her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity.	5778.0654296875
they attacked him
in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour
lady lucas.	5264.41162109375
mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when mr. hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	4957.21484375
i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.	6233.16455078125
there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have enquired of every
body too, who is likely to know."	5654.15673828125
"the indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
at least highly interesting.	5453.6640625
if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them."	5580.6201171875
your conduct would be quite as
dependant on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'bingley, you had better stay
till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month."	5623.0166015625
his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	5790.4111328125
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"	5558.52392578125
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.	5251.759765625
this was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas.	5014.93603515625
the effect was immediate.	5016.48095703125
"caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter.	5781.7861328125
she cared for none
     of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of
     leaving wickham.	5748.93408203125
things are settled so
oddly."	6127.97265625
you may possibly
     wonder why all this was not told you last night.	5786.4638671875
"your's, &c."

this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	4979.498046875
"my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken.	5514.85693359375
upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life, as i have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."	5974.08203125
"i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for
my part, except the shops and public places.	5457.2958984375
he now wished it more than ever.	5810.341796875
"you are a good girl;" he replied, "and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled.	5077.400390625
after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer.	5556.8173828125
i do not wish to avoid the walk.	5433.3974609375
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.	5341.00439453125
"what, has she frightened away
some of your lovers?	5572.2919921875
but
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted.	5349.66015625
mr. darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_.	5211.75
there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."	5469.3994140625
oh!	5525.4013671875
"such as vanity and pride."	5794.7529296875
lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which
becomes herself and daughter.	5487.04736328125
i am glad
he is gone.	6300.12890625
the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
your's.--do you draw?"	5929.33203125
"that is right.--you could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine.	5637.8955078125
she
saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown.	5577.7470703125
hang kitty!	5521.224609375
"my dear mr. bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last?"	5607.40625
lady
catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of
removing all my doubts.	4997.357421875
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word.	5881.61328125
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield and looked in
vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	5432.3193359375
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!	5259.93505859375
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs. bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time.	5992.9296875
in
talking over their route the evening before, mrs. gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again.	5140.1279296875

she

she received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.	5563.896484375
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	6622.765625
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	6072.466796875
mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	6330.7734375
supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it
on his cousin?	5597.03076171875
well, any friend of
mr. bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him."	5562.8193359375

catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.	5882.81396484375
i know your
disposition, lizzy.	5264.12548828125
i shall write again as soon as any
     thing more is determined on.	5732.8212890625
and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road."	5368.5498046875
mr. bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	6193.541015625
mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see mr. jones's shop boy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield
because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards mr. collins by jane's introduction of him.	5430.7294921875

suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)	5431.92578125
they had not been long together, before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley's quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	5582.626953125
they were natural and just.	5310.5302734375
i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least."	5898.5322265625
whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth's astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr. darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance.	5765.30126953125
she is grown so brown and coarse!	5438.13037109375
"i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and
could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.	5353.15087890625
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	5660.85791015625
while
she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	5153.802734375
in ran mrs. bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"my dear jane, make haste and hurry down.	5717.80078125
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but mrs. bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	5400.20166015625
my father supported him at school, and
     afterwards at cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own
     father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
     been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	5339.451171875
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than elizabeth.	5645.2021484375
but are you pleased,
jane?	5236.5859375
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give.	5120.75244140625
"oh!	5150.07861328125
she answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added,

"my eldest sister has been in town these three months.	5284.0029296875
"don't keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven's sake!	5335.53662109375
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.	5444.89208984375
the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire, and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	5688.32763671875
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr.
collins too!--why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"	5416.57763671875
his character
     was to speak for itself.	5584.3896484375
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the
servants remained.	5197.9755859375
he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed.	5316.169921875
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
fixed for the following tuesday.	5519.41357421875
"next time you call," said she, "i hope we shall be more lucky."	5237.90966796875
said she.	5736.9013671875
oh!	5585.369140625
"no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."	5830.4794921875
mrs. hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	5443.412109375
we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.	5633.3701171875
bennet?"	5637.23974609375
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a
book!--when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library."	5289.19580078125
her many attractions were again dwelt on, and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.	5105.611328125
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley's continued
absence.	5302.9892578125
i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.	5683.15478515625
"my dear brother,

     "at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction.	5360.2470703125
"but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure.	5163.8095703125
a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	5581.57275390625
i
always had a value for him.	5014.41943359375
mr. bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr. darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has
received; and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
sister's, mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	5033.70458984375
she looked at jane, to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley.	5280.451171875
"perfectly so--i thank you."	4926.74951171875
she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	5901.345703125
mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,

"i am glad you are come back, lizzy."	5036.7587890625
but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.	5407.38037109375
i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."	5815.9462890625
in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and mr. collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.	5147.6181640625
lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family!	4729.05712890625
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her.	5459.49267578125
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.	5480.1650390625
mrs.
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party.	5409.99560546875
i shall like it of all
things.	5276.85693359375
and with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."	5353.513671875
she knew not what to think, nor how to
account for it.	5413.685546875
though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	5791.2890625
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.	3555.169189453125
with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	6281.7880859375
she felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,
could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.	5748.6708984375
after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "i _do_ remember
his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his
resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	5600.78466796875
i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.	5466.71875
lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins,
and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy."	5602.4033203125
the loo table, however, did not appear.	5891.3251953125
she had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome.	5766.47265625
on the strength of darcy's regard bingley had the
firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	4838.58642578125
the
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was elizabeth's intimate friend.	5522.45703125
how long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am i to wish you
joy?"	5399.9697265625
it is evident that you belong to the
first circles.	5466.8544921875
so, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.	5263.3623046875
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever, on the occasion.	5733.97509765625
had lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr. darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	5581.04052734375
"i might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	5679.39990234375
if he could any how
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach.	5631.53857421875
through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	5925.8388671875
i will not tell you what it is.	5512.91650390625
i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."	5317.173828125
"not one."	5949.1962890625
"of music!	5641.509765625
"your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	5576.7578125
your uncle is as much surprised as i am--and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed
     him to act as he has done.	6228.642578125
he
then said,

"i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly.	5322.49072265625
my object
has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologise."	4781.544921875
but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	4837.9912109375
i longed to
know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	4978.40625
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	5395.259765625
"no, nothing at all."	5572.5947265625
she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	5490.6591796875
in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	5357.72216796875
miss bingley's civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	5684.7373046875
give my love to colonel forster, i hope you
     will drink to our good journey.	5423.47314453125
i cannot think so very ill of
wickham.	5719.9169921875
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared distressed.	5452.53564453125
"why did not you all learn?--you ought all to have learned.	5576.62451171875
chapter i.


it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	5318.6240234375
"_that_ is his notion of christian
forgiveness!	5602.38720703125
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	5337.29248046875
a small sum could not do all this."	5482.6015625
of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.	5256.8662109375
he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man,
asked her how she had liked him.	5881.43408203125
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane, on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had
been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere.	5438.228515625
but who was your mother?	5989.6728515625
"you are severe on us."	5631.9091796875
"that is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	5420.9033203125
"oh, yes.	5675.166015625
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.	5216.23046875
"what is there of good to be expected?"	5581.41845703125
and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said, that he left meryton greatly in
debt; but i hope this may be false."	5595.34423828125
1.f.2.	5541.11083984375
but wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour.	5248.41015625
but she is too much like her brother,--very,
very proud.--as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and
extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her
amusement.	5926.87890625
i defy even sir william lucas
himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law."	5279.509765625
at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!	5694.51513671875
i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."	5396.330078125
his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
mr. darcy with a very expressive smile.	5840.65869140625
chapter xv.	5858.873046875
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side.	4958.2880859375
i fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real
     defect of his character after all.	5251.4794921875
with a strong
prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield.	5501.3046875
"for my own part," she rejoined, "i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her.	5314.61376953125
in short,
i will do my best."	5863.27783203125
see paragraph 1.e below.	5596.0595703125
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	5885.4345703125
"there is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?"	5638.69677734375
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	5855.61669921875
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	5914.93603515625
"but to expose
the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	5883.9365234375
your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father.	5771.4072265625
"what did you say of me, that i did not deserve?	5815.0537109375
they were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs.
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what elizabeth felt.	5397.68896484375
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were
discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	5002.2587890625
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	5697.79638671875
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his
     circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
     to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	5830.57421875
mrs.
reynolds could interest her on no other point.	5158.43994140625
redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.	4538.77783203125
how are they even to be discovered?	5402.88037109375
"did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"	5359.6689453125
she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	5443.537109375
it will save me a world of trouble
and economy.	5738.03955078125
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	6148.4609375
"oh!	5278.06005859375
he had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "i
have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	5463.71142578125
"it was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon
     as his marriage was fixed on.	5859.56640625
has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"	5790.1845703125
take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.	5251.5546875
i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference.	5843.572265625
"is that his design in settling here?"	5645.740234375
*       *       *       *       *

mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	5390.62060546875
i have no pleasure in
talking to undutiful children.--not that i have much pleasure indeed in
talking to any body.	6102.92919921875
no thanks to his gallantry for that.	5727.37890625
all loveliness and goodness as she is!	5540.0595703125
had colonel forster seen denny himself?"	5360.29296875
miss bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.
darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	5836.75
they
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	5628.99365234375
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	5658.12158203125
"indeed you are mistaken.	5596.587890625
who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after
your arrival!"	4781.56298828125
to miss lydia bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	5217.7578125
"i am going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows."	5234.68359375
"i can easily believe it.	5344.29052734375
he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	5225.12744140625
"oh!	5363.197265625
"how so?	5863.5068359375
it is enough to know they are discovered, i have seen them
     both----"

"then it is, as i always hoped," cried jane; "they are married!"	5380.49755859375
i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	5224.69921875
and she was only sixteen last june.	5658.326171875
"i comfort myself with thinking," replied jane, "that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	5623.99267578125
it was a rational scheme to be sure!	4390.529296875
and she rose as she spoke.	5920.04345703125
it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy.	4953.3251953125
she is well, and begs to be dutifully
     remembered to you and her mother.--your's, &c.

     "e.	5702.65087890625
thoughtless and indiscreet i
     can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)
     marks nothing bad at heart.	5534.4462890625
how is
such a man to be worked on?	5012.25830078125
so imprudent a
     match on both sides!--but i am willing to hope the best, and that
     his character has been misunderstood.	5745.3662109375
i have a high respect for your nerves.	4940.625
such a disappointment!	5502.3173828125
lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.	5396.8037109375
how strange must it appear to him!	5315.39453125
one morning, about a week after bingley's engagement with jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn.	5321.08984375
did you see him while you were at lambton?	5564.2783203125
if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy!	5325.81640625
"mr. darcy is not to be laughed at!"	6162.79638671875
every body was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.	4755.6953125
he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all.	5660.27490234375
her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	5442.26513671875
she was teazed by
mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.	5390.923828125
never, even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations at
rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.	4566.373046875
"it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
bingley.	5718.44970703125
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
     intended elopement, and then georgiana, unable to support the idea
     of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
     a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	5633.14990234375
"i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth.	5621.60107421875
mrs. reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father's life time.	5608.31005859375
"are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"	5905.9345703125
"upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield.	5446.36181640625
but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for?	5636.6806640625
promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford."	4902.06005859375
his
friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
ten days time.	5737.69482421875
it was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	5855.4208984375
"by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
     letter; i wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
     confined for time, my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer
     for being coherent.	5009.92626953125
but she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity.	5669.81591796875
each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of mr. darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr. bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them.	5171.3154296875
perhaps other people have said so before, but not one
     with such justice.	5015.4384765625
they are
wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?"	6093.1123046875
his own
     father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these
     events, mr. wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally
     resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should not think it
     unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary
     advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
     benefited.	5458.13916015625
there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable.	5872.95947265625
said
jane.--"i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her."	5511.029296875
but i can guess how it was;
every body says that he is ate up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."	5457.55615234375
in her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	5578.2841796875
_your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of
ignorance.	4941.85009765625
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission
from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	5586.7919921875
elizabeth was forced to go.	5228.970703125
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
mr. bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st. james's.	5872.931640625
this information, however, startled mrs. bennet;--she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe
it, and could not help saying so.	5946.84765625
"this is an evening of wonders, indeed!	5939.1171875
"from the former.	5603.0498046875
"i know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	5319.212890625
"it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire.	6814.123046875
"yes; but when questioned by _him_ denny denied knowing any thing of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	5420.77880859375
though her manner
varied however, her determination never did.	5381.015625
"how should you have liked making sermons?"	5577.9970703125
anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	5755.5556640625
elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.	5734.232421875
"i will go to meryton," said she, "as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister philips.	5129.03662109375
it adds even another motive.	5238.21435546875
say that
urgent business calls us home immediately.	5024.9658203125
the compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	5761.431640625
i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if i had not asked you!	5507.71923828125
lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,

"do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard,
and if he does, colonel forster will hire him.	5606.0322265625
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.	4776.3994140625
"we
can all plague and punish one another.	5370.89013671875
"but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	5445.509765625
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	5233.001953125
mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she
were indisposed.	5471.62158203125
her air
was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to
make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	5398.1572265625
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents.	5437.89697265625
mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.	5234.56884765625
the discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	5477.3701171875
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	4908.7587890625
"i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression.	5401.56640625
but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.	5446.27880859375
a lively imagination soon settled it all.	5461.20068359375
could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related?	5390.8466796875
1.f.1.	5705.12060546875
lydia--the
humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	5698.71484375
but i must write no more.	5271.228515625
elizabeth replied that it was.	5313.41796875
she was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy,
she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.	5805.01904296875
elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes.	5483.66796875
she was dying to know what could
be his meaning"--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand
him?	5787.3251953125
you may depend upon my seeking no further."	5876.03515625
he took the hint,
and when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,

"that will do extremely well, child.	5755.50048828125
darcy mentioned his letter.	5745.49755859375
"you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.	6043.568359375
i am so
pleased--so happy.	5431.26806640625
but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."	5464.107421875
"how i long to see her again!	6026.58984375
the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.	5616.119140625
pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."	5733.9697265625
the subjection in which his father had brought him up, had
given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.	5640.8642578125
"her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."	5481.04345703125
his sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.	5584.76220703125
the account of his connection with the pemberley family, was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.	5596.5400390625
1.f.	5422.9716796875
the eldest miss bennet
beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point."	5390.3740234375
what is it about?	5497.041015625
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them.	5428.06787109375
but now it comes out."	5620.48583984375
with a stronger voice she soon added, "i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to any one but myself."	5597.404296875
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on
guard, and dressing a sallad and cucumber.	5692.783203125
his coming into the country at all, is a
most insolent thing indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it.	5729.73876953125
she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.	5822.611328125
there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much.	4719.85205078125
i am not qualified to form one.	5458.9873046875
he came to tell mr. gardiner that
     he had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were, and that
     he had seen and talked with them both, wickham repeatedly, lydia
     once.	5686.53759765625
"and _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london!	5213.69873046875
four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	5530.63671875
but here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet.	5442.0732421875
london:
printed for t. egerton,
military library, whitehall.	6017.876953125
in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.	6257.3994140625
when i went away, i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again!	5766.7470703125
we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."	5428.1923828125
our poor mother
     is sadly grieved.	6036.4658203125
but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	4915.88916015625
"no really," replied elizabeth; "i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."	5376.00439453125
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously
so strong an affection.	5332.69287109375
he owed a good deal in
the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	6063.68212890625
i do not deserve it.	5365.35107421875
accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.	5850.43115234375
"my dear niece,

     "i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as i foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what i have to tell you.	5357.78857421875
"i confess," said he, "that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings.	5122.974609375
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making many enquiries, which jane was equally eager to
satisfy.	5143.0400390625
he then told her of georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.	5210.93505859375
it would have suited
me in every respect."	5891.1171875
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began.	5927.359375
"oh, yes!--he was to come there with wickham, you know.	5074.8828125
as for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin elizabeth."	5372.18115234375
her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, "why is he so altered?	5541.6708984375
a lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony in a moment.	5643.646484375
i was ready to die of laughter.	5752.2138671875
and even mary could assure her family
that she had no disinclination for it.	5364.21484375
mr.
darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	5712.7861328125
"i cannot believe it.	5359.19921875
"i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.	5186.37890625
mrs. bennet said only, "nonsense,
nonsense!"	6215.9853515625
the hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object.	5859.2646484375
all that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum.	5015.6533203125
indeed he has no improper pride.	5728.078125
[illustration: a vicarage house.]	5846.203125
they insist also on
     my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
     there is not much the matter with me.	5786.9443359375
next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	5459.03955078125
for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter.	4893.8154296875
what felicity!	5222.8955078125
he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.	5607.0908203125
"well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle?	5283.58984375
mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
wonder, and when at last mr. collins allowed him time to speak, replied
with an air of distant civility.	5399.5166015625
"oh!	5097.58349609375
"you cannot be too much on your guard.	5601.50048828125
elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	6354.90234375
could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy
for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	5623.4345703125
yet now i must believe you," cried
jane.	5951.5
i did not wink at you."	5320.283203125
the housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	5741.39501953125
"as soon as ever mr. bingley comes, my dear," said mrs. bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."	6140.9365234375
that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	5577.94921875
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	5719.7802734375
i came to try you.	5163.578125
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	4958.38232421875
it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.	5508.4599609375
sometimes one
officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion.	5470.71923828125
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.	5915.81640625
let me know every thing that i am to know, without delay.	5903.77197265625
she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be.	5459.8466796875
elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
at one end of the room.	4874.45263671875
but that is nothing to us.	5583.287109375
but don't imagine it was from
any silly cause.	5786.67919921875
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	5598.66455078125
and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said
a word about it till now."	5222.556640625
i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together.	5724.8720703125
but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	5371.25390625
i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	5650.39453125
"there were some very strong objections against the lady," were colonel
fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in london.	5725.794921875
repeated miss bingley.	5413.25732421875
oh!	5690.44921875
let her go then.	5900.89013671875
they would doubtless be congenial with
the generality of female minds.	5820.0576171875
elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.	5693.76611328125
as we went along, kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.	5932.392578125
we must not
all expect jane's good fortune."	5556.25048828125
"my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you love me.	5491.13037109375
but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.	5649.78515625
i am
perfectly satisfied.	5454.98046875
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep
his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."	6142.63525390625
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment,
from which she had been so wholly free at first.	5319.33984375
*       *       *       *       *

it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey.	5381.8525390625
i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."	5682.88916015625
"some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	5427.77294921875
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.	6023.5673828125
elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others.	5426.3544921875
i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world i love, and he is an angel.	5643.9208984375
"so much the better.	6099.466796875
but make a virtue of it
by all means.	4814.87109375
i am very, very sorry.	5558.158203125
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	5025.564453125
i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.	5216.513671875
"and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added kitty.	5380.19482421875
"i will make no promise of the kind."	5360.947265625
charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	6249.2353515625
"i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."	5281.0859375
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."	5314.78125
he called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on
     by himself.	5691.3720703125
elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.	5208.09814453125
"you may depend upon it, madam," said miss bingley, with cold civility,
"that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."	5660.74462890625
but
nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done.	5328.7275390625
catherine and lydia had
information for them of a different sort.	5621.4345703125
this is the estimation in which you hold me!	6015.7138671875
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	5342.81298828125
"why will you think so?	5659.5947265625
the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.	5176.1455078125
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	5311.7509765625
there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire."	5198.58544921875
replied kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before.	5136.599609375
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be
unpardonable in _me_."	5690.03662109375
i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn."	5253.85888671875
elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.	5496.044921875
i
hope he will overlook it.	5204.8359375
i should infinitely prefer a book."	5167.69189453125
but really, and upon my
honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now, i hope you
are satisfied."	5669.61572265625
you have widely mistaken my
character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	5456.759765625
mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.	5533.8974609375
"we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice!--how much i shall have to tell!"	5274.4970703125
"blame you!	5854.38818359375
had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?"	5097.5546875
"these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature.	5040.3671875
i dare say the
lace upon mrs. hurst's gown----"

here she was interrupted again.	5248.5751953125
"elizabeth, you are not serious now."	5636.21826171875
elizabeth however did not chuse to
take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.	5483.119140625
you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you."	5761.84912109375
society, i own, is necessary to me.	5640.42333984375
i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming.	5741.6962890625
she had been unwilling to
mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend.	5603.263671875
i have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	5139.3876953125
"while mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to mr.	5191.44140625
"to be sure, lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as wickham;
or rather he has not wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good.	5387.8759765625
their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."	6113.2802734375
the garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every
thing declared they were arriving.	4820.02099609375
his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every
thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory
of his father."	5534.67822265625
"yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.	5105.45068359375
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday.	5843.7841796875
and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless.	5266.5908203125
what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"	5477.97607421875
collins, you
must marry.	5561.7744140625
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications."	5313.341796875
she was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle.	5758.267578125
"but it is fortunate," thought she, "that i have something to wish for.	5336.900390625
"merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.	4984.1875
but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.	5299.7333984375
he observed to her, at a
moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had
the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "it
is above eight months.	5456.81689453125
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
pemberley.	5632.1025390625
her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	5619.666015625
mr. philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.	5428.0107421875
but my dear lydia, i don't
at all like your going such a way off.	5078.59130859375
she stood several minutes before the picture in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery.	6323.13427734375
i perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	5652.005859375
what say you,
mary?	5670.52978515625
"oh!	5253.44287109375
how could i
     be so silly as to wish it!	4163.2890625
she was disappointed,
and angry with herself for being so.	5660.0048828125
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and
     all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	4415.8759765625
calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home, instantly.	5762.60205078125
"how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!"	5355.56640625
"can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"	5410.9033203125
"neglect!	5684.7373046875
there was
another reason too for her opposition.	4763.7890625
they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	5777.068359375
i have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, i should think you could not do better.	5933.02587890625
mr. wickham's happiness and her own was per force
delayed a little longer, and mr. collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.	5419.4453125
she highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	5258.04443359375
"neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance.	5194.54150390625
i came to you without a
doubt of my reception.	5495.22705078125
"let us sit down.	5560.4541015625
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "to
treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his
father!"	5601.56982421875
"upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter, darcy must speak for
himself."	5648.853515625
but papa is so
disagreeable."	5529.349609375
you give me
fresh life and vigour.	5705.419921875
any place would do, of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr. darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.	5349.2470703125
his daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative.	5090.00048828125
"but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity."	6096.33251953125
"but what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what
can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"	4953.75537109375
"you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr.	5536.44677734375
"an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth.	5326.64453125
i enquired after their brother, of course.	5611.6650390625
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter, depended on the will of the parents.	5559.2451171875
it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing than any other man."	6156.56982421875
elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	5289.08984375
"you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	5373.8564453125
mrs.
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	5693.7333984375
the second began.	5212.48583984375
you tear them to pieces."	5236.20166015625
'tis as good as a lord!	5232.17822265625
no officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village.	5656.74560546875
they had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which mrs.
bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	5620.4482421875
and then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it.	5722.3447265625
_i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united."	5118.19384765625
"it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not
visit them."	5638.27734375
you know my sentiments."	5376.4248046875
elizabeth now began to revive.	5211.4521484375
the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a
young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been
brought up by him at his own expence.--"he is now gone into the army,"
she added, "but i am afraid he has turned out very wild."	5218.24560546875
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object.	5474.048828125
mr. gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; mrs. reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.	5513.4111328125
i mend
pens remarkably well."	4501.90625
"mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."	5592.3359375
"i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield.	5369.42041015625
"yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."	5453.63818359375
"that would be a good scheme," said elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."	5590.6396484375
by tea-time however the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad to
take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad
to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	5949.36669921875
"you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."	5735.1181640625
the two youngest of the family,
catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt.	6147.67529296875
you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by any one."	5590.74658203125
"in what an amiable light does this place him!"	5719.796875
"and we mean to treat you all," added lydia; "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."	5733.61962890625
"and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow, and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever look into."	5562.01318359375
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	5216.7724609375
their manners are not equal to his."	5781.65380859375
oh!	5375.4970703125
"but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about.	5363.01806640625
mrs. gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of jane and elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the
conversation.	5107.4130859375
it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way.	5321.94775390625
my poor father!	5593.423828125
the vicious propensities--the
     want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
     of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
     of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
     seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr. darcy could not have.	5768.677734375
is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	5726.0244140625
"why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	5719.927734375
you are so strange!	5500.41259765625
said he, smiling.	5470.29638671875
while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had
done to his presentation at st. james's.	5225.630859375
he is perfectly amiable.	5563.4296875
the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
dovedale, or the peak.	5600.634765625
"not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."	5873.087890625
but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew.	5749.0712890625
"no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."	5249.912109375
who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	5737.62890625
but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take the
trouble of practising.	5241.96728515625
elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was.	5445.72265625
"yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"	5586.1259765625
she was then but
     fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
     imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
     herself.	5147.6923828125
the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	5738.8876953125
that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.	5293.03076171875
she had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge.	5606.20849609375
the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr. bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.	5534.03955078125
my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	5368.49853515625
on this
subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i left
hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs. jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'mr.	4806.05810546875
chapter iii.	5632.23681640625
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.	5364.849609375
it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "say
nothing of that.	5467.69384765625
my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.	5141.681640625
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds
was of no trifling nature.	5383.68994140625
she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	5609.42822265625
he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes.	4998.36767578125
"do you really think so?"	5649.5966796875
my poor mother is really ill
     and keeps her room.	5242.62255859375
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
think it is well expressed."	5574.1572265625
and for _this_ we are to be
thankful.	5645.73486328125
mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and
mrs. hurst was observing their game.	5251.0986328125
"i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!"	5669.5185546875
if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
     disgrace him.	5445.650390625
she attracted him more than he liked--and miss
bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	4899.0546875
in a few minutes, mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out,

"lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you."	5088.57373046875
there
is nothing he would not do for her."	3642.55419921875
elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham's name.	5638.44921875
they were off saturday night about twelve, as
     is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
     eight.	5398.50732421875
after
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read.	5366.27197265625
she will be taken good care of.	5222.21337890625
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.	5672.85009765625
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that mr. darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself.	5744.08984375
"i had much rather go in the coach."	5551.9228515625
"you did!	5294.75244140625
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and mrs. bennet with great politeness and cordiality said
how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his
other engagements might allow him to visit them.	5246.1435546875
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	5509.46337890625
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr. bingley.	5875.939453125
she could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	6123.82421875
he spoke well, but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride.	5657.986328125
she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	5316.3828125
chapter xiii.	5455.662109375
cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr. darcy appeared.	5544.79541015625
"and they are really to be married!"	6579.7490234375
"you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound.	5791.6923828125
they were
rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves, and meanly of others.	5392.060546875
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	4863.294921875
this preservative she had now
obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	5503.3876953125
elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such
disapprobation.	5529.771484375
we will go round the park every day.	5259.71923828125
these
were the contents:

     "my dear harriet,

     "you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
     missed.	5004.955078125
compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	5499.1591796875
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the mean time.	4881.7470703125
it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	5500.119140625
now, lizzy, i think i _have_
surprised you.	5229.1455078125
charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by kitty,
who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where mrs. bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family.	5731.0341796875
darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence.	5773.25146484375
it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return.	5877.587890625
let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."	5785.9619140625
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	5329.28173828125
now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said,

"mr. darcy, i am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much i may be wounding your's.	5600.39990234375
the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country.	5804.3603515625
you blamed me for coming?"	5460.2529296875
and so, darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission!	5545.3720703125
imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham and our poor lydia
     would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for
     there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland.	4866.162109375
when all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish.	5481.4560546875
"_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza," said
charlotte.	5287.42578125
it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.	5643.19970703125
"certainly not."	5849.65576171875
"we may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall.	5466.2861328125
he spoke of it as a certain event,
     of which the time alone could be undecided.	5874.4833984375
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene.	5897.728515625
the comfort to _her_,
of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	5371.9658203125
had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends in lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure.	5072.49755859375
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country.	5785.69140625
"are they indeed?"	5449.57275390625
"could i expect it to be otherwise!"	5534.86328125
chapter xvi.	5597.19091796875
four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.	5169.732421875
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."	5558.046875
on the very day of my coming
     home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	5357.61474609375
but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication.	5835.341796875
"how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?"	5981.212890625
i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him.	5644.25439453125
that lady i suppose is your mother."	5918.654296875
pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!	6052.6474609375
elizabeth could not but look surprised.	5537.8251953125
"true.	5603.8515625
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth.	5468.27783203125
charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.	5509.66845703125
they must all go to brighton.	5600.255859375
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."	4908.50146484375
her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire.	5583.5322265625
he owns it
himself without disguise."	5894.876953125
"nor i, i am sure," said miss bingley.	5620.51806640625
elizabeth's impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr.
darcy and herself.	5123.052734375
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was
shocked.	5100.50146484375
if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh.	5382.22705078125
you both did as much as you could, in planning the
marriage.	5291.49658203125
she cried.--"i, who have prided myself on
my discernment!--i, who have valued myself on my abilities!	5198.18896484375
one may be continually
abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."	5280.4765625
he begged
pardon for having displeased her.	5771.814453125
he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."	6033.421875
"we will go as far as meryton with you," said catherine and
lydia.--elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
off together.	5819.12548828125
he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune.	5408.31884765625
"an easy distance do you call it?	5859.4931640625
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king, during his mayoralty.	5547.00634765625
"and i have another favour to ask.	5761.51953125
ring the bell,
kitty, for hill.	5478.78564453125
chapter x.


elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as
soon as she possibly could.	6188.8349609375
as to
his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
felt a wish of enquiring.	5654.458984375
why should they try to influence him?	5040.189453125
so
genteel and so easy!--he has always something to say to every
body.--_that_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy
themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
matter."	5712.333984375
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she
did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	5934.095703125
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	5347.298828125
i cannot quite agree with you _there_.	5740.8583984375
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.	5399.86181640625
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	5530.68408203125
the invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	5794.3828125
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.	3733.51806640625
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations.	5407.1279296875
but now she would no longer
conceal from her, his share in lydia's marriage.	5358.07958984375
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.	5416.94970703125
will you be very angry with me, my dear
     lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold
     enough to say before) how much i like him.	6167.55322265625
"can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?"	5516.53515625
"i have sent for
you on an affair of importance.	5587.916015625
"can it be
possible that he will marry her?"	5312.84521484375
i am quite well.	6196.26416015625
louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again."	5157.318359375
"but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.	5577.2626953125
now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?	5303.01953125
cried elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves.	5399.5888671875
they met several times,
     for there was much to be discussed.	5602.611328125
"lady catherine, i have nothing farther to say.	5609.25146484375
"his misfortunes!"	5303.5458984375
"it keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and i am more obliged to you than i can express."	5646.98974609375
"oh yes!--they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
scotland."	5338.75341796875
elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.	5585.52392578125
during dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	5756.548828125
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	5803.09814453125
mr. darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"miss elizabeth bennet."	5076.1220703125
i knew it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend denny tempted me
farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.	5168.1748046875
"you quite mistook mr. darcy.	5252.69140625
eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	5711.29931640625
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.	5378.84033203125
to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.	4910.201171875
her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.	5929.564453125
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.	4842.7734375
"he did not talk to me of his own arts," said fitzwilliam smiling.	5600.34130859375
she told the story
however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	5663.3525390625
in every view it
is unaccountable!"	5525.67578125
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	5811.6220703125
i often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired,
without constant practice.	5581.31201171875
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.	5829.82373046875
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire.	6411.14306640625
no, never.	5414.8525390625
the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes, since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants.	5527.72607421875
he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	5584.6875
from their infancy,
they have been intended for each other.	5259.75439453125
my dear charles, what do you mean?"	5182.88330078125
he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
an hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.	5769.61328125
but
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy mr. collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's
praise into his own hands.	6001.15380859375
"yours, &c."

as it happened that elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	4784.5595703125
nothing was
     to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure (and i do
     not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your
     uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	5420.3037109375
"to-morrow fortnight."	5472.341796875
surprise was the least
of her feelings on this developement.	5901.81298828125
"_mr.	5405.2099609375
you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."	5449.712890625
you deserve no such attention.	5467.2822265625
cried elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--how could
his will be disregarded?--why did not you seek legal redress?"	5544.94873046875
her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	6193.4345703125
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to
render mr. darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	5725.26513671875
and, above all things, keep mr. bennet from
fighting.	5182.49267578125
they may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically anything with public domain ebooks.	5741.44970703125
"there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way.	5700.23681640625
it is too long ago.	5897.4130859375
as for
their mother, mr. collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which
astonished her husband and daughters.	5344.47412109375
she did indeed.	5438.09375
it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."	5832.876953125
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.	5008.05859375
for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.	5524.8798828125
miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding."	5637.3525390625
i will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back
again."	5319.23828125
for my part, i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody.	5752.9541015625
after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.	5507.115234375
mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	5538.07861328125
a clergyman like you must marry.--chuse properly, chuse a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.	5370.4599609375
"but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."	5546.05419921875
my avowed one, or what i avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made."	5729.80419921875
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	5297.4345703125
it is mr. wickham's intention to go
     into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still
     some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	5275.0859375

"i often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends.	5362.17431640625
i congratulate her.	5043.37744140625
"i have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech.	5327.5947265625
"i never saw any one so shocked.	5180.2841796875
mrs. collins knew not what to make of him.	5523.3837890625

"his pride," said miss lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.	5090.72412109375
"indeed," replied elizabeth, "i am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	5980.015625
_he_ was
     exactly what he had been, when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
     would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she staid with us, if i had not perceived, by jane's letter
     last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you, can give you no
     fresh pain.	5554.724609375
much as i abominate
writing, i would not give up mr. collins's correspondence for any
consideration.	5038.98779296875
what did colonel
forster say?	5871.22900390625
i do not know who is
good enough for him."	5319.4462890625
"you can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	5693.72265625
she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"is your sister at pemberley still?"	5937.095703125
mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	5845.86328125
he who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without
any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion
of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	5445.49951171875
dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	5073.40673828125
perhaps i am not doing her justice.	5237.849609375
i am impatient to see him."	4901.4052734375
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	5270.4091796875
"believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	5872.287109375
i thought
we never should have got into the coach.	5574.89111328125
"i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of
the ball.	4962.431640625
you have
withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for
him.	5427.55029296875
in such an exigence my uncle's advice and
     assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately
     comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness."	5507.14697265625
we have reason to imagine
that his aunt, lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye."	6146.09228515625
bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	4843.7939453125
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself
to assist mr. wickham with money."	4965.6083984375
we
shall be at newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some
balls, and i will take care to get good partners for them all."	5529.296875

then pray speak aloud.	5507.95068359375
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	5472.84814453125
it is mr. bingley
i am sure.	5694.1025390625
but these things happen so often!	5388.04052734375
kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon.	5390.1015625
"it must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."	5243.0322265625
but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity
     of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given
     the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her
     temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--that i was
     desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but i will
     venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually
     influenced by my hopes or fears.--i did not believe her to be
     indifferent because i wished it;--i believed it on impartial
     conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.--my objections to
     the marriage were not merely those, which i last night acknowledged
     to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my
     own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
     my friend as to me.--but there were other causes of
     repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to
     an equal degree in both instances, i had myself endeavoured to
     forget, because they were not immediately before me.--these causes
     must be stated, though briefly.--the situation of your mother's
     family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that
     total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
     by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
     your father.--pardon me.--it pains me to offend you.	5641.7626953125
the
upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune.	6033.38671875
she has known him only a fortnight.	5639.71337890625
she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan,
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty.	5340.8564453125
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind!	5126.787109375
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.	5145.3115234375
"but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."	5501.283203125
"very true; and if i had my will, we should.	6410.46435546875
i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."	5136.6435546875
if i wished to think slightingly
of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."	5482.9150390625
you refuse, then, to oblige me.	5362.21533203125
but at length, by elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	5996.07958984375
she practises very constantly."	5942.73779296875
if she heard me,
     it was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen.	6477.3251953125
our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."	5586.70654296875
the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church, and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."	5597.9755859375
what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.	5959.41796875
they were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance,
taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he
welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble
abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	5617.828125
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.	5462.27880859375
"it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."	5384.88134765625
"did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	5136.0654296875
"i am sure i shall break _mine_," said lydia.	4483.2607421875
by supposing such an
affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.	5556.70068359375
the pause was to elizabeth's feelings
dreadful.	5961.77099609375
their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme.	5464.28466796875
"is it possible!"	5590.6455078125
i believe i have now told you every thing.	5350.09912109375
our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----you shall try it
some day.--do your sisters play and sing?"	4995.232421875
"it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
ease, cannot write ill."

"that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline," cried her
brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	5640.86962890625
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	5591.5625
jane was as much gratified by this, as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.	5410.16064453125
vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled!	5969.5029296875
she did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	5797.88720703125
it is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.	5642.9140625
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life
is so decidedly beneath my own?"	4597.064453125
she had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	5540.36083984375
i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr. collins's
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."	6027.31396484375
her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his
judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as
to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable.	5354.7392578125
my kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till i am better.	5671.470703125
it is nearly fifty miles."	5544.36181640625
mrs. bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"well, jane, who is it from?	5617.533203125
"no," replied jane, "i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.	5218.8076171875
those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	5601.8798828125
single, my dear, to be sure!	5265.84765625
when you told mrs.
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"	5223.7724609375
it was lady catherine de bourgh.	4918.6796875
i can recal nothing worse.	4926.27978515625
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton.	5104.939453125
but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will
take it on myself."	5347.56884765625
"in the first place," replied mr. gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland."	5530.7001953125
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them.	5825.8828125
what a stroke was this for poor jane!	5270.68603515625
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	5482.6640625
"but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"	5262.1279296875
mr. gardiner declared his
willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	5633.85400390625
an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.	5502.82080078125
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.	5259.142578125
chapter xi.	5664.5517578125
now is your time.	5379.81494140625
cried miss bingley.	5733.7509765625
but i will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	5573.66845703125
