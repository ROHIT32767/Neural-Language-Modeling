4769.470996608815
that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.	4438.55712890625
after this period, every
     appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	4857.79736328125
thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!"	5900.884765625
he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire.	4874.7314453125
had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you.	5450.939453125
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	5248.58544921875
"there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."	4753.09765625
in revolving lady catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference.	4376.166015625
they are not married,
     nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
     your side, i hope it will not be long before they are.	5019.3759765625
[illustration: morning dress.	6514.1103515625
his appearance was
greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	4700.59912109375
"your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family," said elizabeth,
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."	4249.23828125
as soon as jane had read mr. gardiner's hope of lydia's
being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence
added to its exuberance.	5058.91259765625
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield.	5350.24169921875
and what sort of table do they keep?	5601.19580078125
"i have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness.	4322.0029296875
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of
     the kingdom.	4683.0595703125
here, leading the way through every walk and cross
walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he
asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind.	4848.80859375
mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips, and
_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.	4259.7431640625
the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	3874.32568359375
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together.	5098.70703125
two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.	4021.406494140625
i don't know.	5112.3544921875
at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting!	4194.0576171875
my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal."	3575.07275390625
her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.	4135.4267578125
but, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, i am determined.	4238.416015625
not that
i care about it, though.	4362.7275390625
elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	4253.12646484375
by you, i was properly humbled.	4822.7568359375
bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.	4510.166015625
"i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, for any thing about the entail.	4392.12939453125
he really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.	4188.43798828125
my aunt told me so
herself on saturday.	5519.12939453125
bingley will not be detained in london by
them."	3684.21923828125
you see on
what a footing we are.	5063.744140625
oh!	4214.208984375
two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	5694.265625
are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"	5074.6552734375
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,

"no, no; stay where you are.--you are charmingly group'd, and appear to
uncommon advantage.	4446.216796875
a few days after this visit, mr. bingley called again, and alone.	4438.3837890625
"it does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt.	5128.029296875
"you doubt me," cried jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no
reason.	4357.9248046875
he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.	4782.009765625
my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther
consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	5509.248046875
"exceedingly well.	4853.25
"certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.	4929.61669921875
it was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried.	5105.5673828125
"it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."	4480.5419921875
with a
book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.	5846.705078125
"perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson; did not
i mention it to you?	4696.8486328125
mrs. bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of june
kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope, that by
the following christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in
meryton.	4602.8505859375
"i did not think you would;--and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."	5030.52294921875
"it must have been his sister's doing.	4596.546875
you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand your
     attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
     demand it of your justice.	4721.7294921875
in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	4911.765625
if the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.	4690.69384765625
miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.	4935.8447265625
they then sat down, and when her enquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	4256.177734375
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.	4788.38525390625
i
     take up my pen again to do, what i have just told you i would not,
     but circumstances are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging
     you all to come here, as soon as possible.	4782.228515625
to no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was
possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley's connections her
brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own.	4216.30712890625
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.	4572.21240234375
i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."	4302.8095703125
"not that i _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."	5510.82470703125
elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had
known sir william's too long.	4687.76904296875
she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.	4562.41650390625
what he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	4486.16015625
"you may depend upon my not mentioning it."	4812.1123046875
it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	5170.5556640625
his words
seemed to imply it.	2970.60400390625
yet, indeed, i am
in earnest.	5321.73974609375
conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible.--i know it cannot be long."	4457.29345703125
he heard her attentively, and then said,

"lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."	3876.2548828125
no, no,
you shall not deceive me.	4889.1181640625
it convinced her, that
accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister's being in town.	4583.37548828125
"how abominable!--i wonder that the very
pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you!--if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it."	4550.23681640625
"if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful.	4627.9658203125
for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	4851.607421875
the letter was to this
effect:

     "my dear lizzy,

     "i wish you joy.	4929.0380859375
what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant?	4859.23828125
"i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	5257.5732421875
every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane.	5015.39501953125
"i did not think caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london.	4163.56689453125
"you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!	4692.9443359375
"i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."	5546.9267578125
she was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.	4328.49169921875
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her
at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of
appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	4079.0546875
thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."	4918.7216796875
on the contrary she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.--it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.--she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.	5075.27490234375
elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"i was surprised to see darcy in town last month.	3881.141357421875
my aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and i was determined at once to know every thing."	4645.03369140625
his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking.	4335.55615234375
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes' conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.	3787.592041015625
she
looked at jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	9156.3583984375
thought she.	4932.11328125
they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.	4568.81689453125
"well," said charlotte, "i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.	5128.55712890625
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a
man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and
pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	5163.05126953125
only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.	4682.041015625
"my dear friend,

     "if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.	4542.40625
i do assure you, that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain.	4794.66357421875
her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.	4779.37451171875
all were struck with the stranger's air,
all wondered who he could be, and kitty and lydia, determined if
possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of
wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same
spot.	4552.08984375
but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could."	4922.8935546875
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	4952.55078125
if you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	4919.125
regard for my sister's credit and feelings
     prevented any public exposure, but i wrote to mr. wickham, who left
     the place immediately, and mrs. younge was of course removed from
     her charge.	5167.568359375
"what is his name?"	5599.9462890625
"what do you think?	4493.02783203125
mr. collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	5330.857421875
chapter xviii.	4399.17626953125
i have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with.	4795.7978515625
"they have both," said she, "been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.	5089.65625
elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	4413.130859375
but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	5904.7236328125
are
you going much farther?"	4370.8359375
he was well, but so much
engaged with mr. darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	5309.80078125
do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any project gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.e.8 or 1.e.9.	5385.79052734375
no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation.	4346.3984375
elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend, for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.	4956.77490234375
she replied in the affirmative.	4573.83935546875
"kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room."	4411.6962890625
he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."	4795.18017578125
she tried to
recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr.
darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what mr. darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	5313.580078125
chapter xii.	5694.8740234375
they all paint tables, cover skreens and net
purses.	4560.1240234375
"a man who had felt less, might."	4765.86572265625
if you'll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight.	4656.375
send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly.	5549.1806640625
had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement
took place?	3659.947265625
"and so was i."	5153.7978515625
"la!"	5246.078125
creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a united states copyright in these works, so the foundation
(and you!)	4194.41357421875
oh!	4949.8876953125
"oh!	5102.2236328125
jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.	5925.697265625
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	1375.7852783203125
and to see dear wickham too!	3680.753173828125
darcy."	4552.6416015625
"i do not know.	4749.99365234375
lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	4433.1337890625
any thing beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far."	4935.21875
darcy smiled and said, "you are perfectly right.	4194.005859375
"what will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are!	4806.25537109375
forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante."	4353.18505859375
your's, &c.

     "edw.	4444.13525390625
colonel
fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love, her friend eliza, she sat herself
seriously to work to find it out.--she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success.	4955.73046875
"well," cried elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	4578.65283203125
you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it."	4678.36767578125
"that is not very likely; our authority was too good."	5393.77294921875
lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars.	4676.31591796875
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined
and unvarying society."	5291.1025390625
she answered him with cold civility.	5188.12548828125
elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "lord,
how tired i am!"	4372.53271484375
could he expect that her friends
would not step forward?	4662.90283203125
you have no compassion on my poor nerves."	4998.57763671875
to mr. bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	4800.4697265625
"she had better have stayed at home," cried elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one's neighbours.	4146.80078125
her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr. darcy then
was.	4602.6181640625
you are not going to be _missish_, i
hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	5317.802734375
"nay," cried bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.	6013.763671875
your sister i also watched.--her look and
     manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any
     symptom of peculiar regard, and i remained convinced from the
     evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with
     pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
     sentiment.--if _you_ have not been mistaken here, _i_ must have
     been in an error.	4628.68994140625
i am prodigiously proud of him.	3796.4775390625
had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!	4344.33056640625
in that
county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	4495.9853515625
she then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,

"come here, my love, i want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	4644.32080078125
such an openness and gentleness in his manner."	4036.46826171875
when is your turn to come?	5228.5419921875
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of
meeting its owner returned.	4619.96240234375
had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	5776.17041015625
they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.	4963.62939453125
that he has neither integrity nor honour.	5334.8193359375
and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.	5337.6591796875
lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.	4415.5263671875
nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	4122.5390625
he did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september, than any body else in the country.	5184.08447265625
she had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	5071.23486328125
"i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from any one but myself.	4597.90185546875
chapter xv.	4463.669921875
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.	5248.4150390625
to the civil enquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr. bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer.	4173.732421875
this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving.	5493.9541015625
"what, is he coming home, and without poor lydia!"	4976.33203125
they are gone off together
from brighton.	4985.337890625
elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself.	4397.48583984375
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself.	4912.00439453125
"i do not pretend to
regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire, except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean
while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.	6106.142578125
"to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."	4634.00341796875
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.	4958.92138671875
his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.	4073.88427734375
your superior knowledge of your sister must make
     the latter probable.--if it be so, if i have been misled by such
     error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
     unreasonable.	5453.2587890625
there was one part
especially, the opening of it, which i should dread your having the
power of reading again.	4028.9111328125
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in paragraph 1.f.3.	4532.5361328125
she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in
it.	5076.54296875
"he is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good
humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners!--so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!"	4735.63720703125
it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.	4506.21044921875
interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.	4764.98388671875
mr. denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr. wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in
their corps.	3781.175048828125
"and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."	4566.27734375
oh, no."	4422.64013671875
"my dear, you flatter me.	4216.1826171875
she was overpowered by shame and
vexation.	4848.328125
cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	4680.041015625
she asked her at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother's maiden name?--elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.--lady catherine then
observed,

"your father's estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think.	4827.34033203125
i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness, to which you, i imagine, have been alluding,
is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe.	5866.7958984375
if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."	4194.41357421875
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.	4488.958984375
"oh!	5004.826171875
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	4504.59912109375
--she could have added, "a young man too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented
herself with "and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner!"	4881.1279296875
she knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an
hour.	6280.123046875
lady catherine herself says
that in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.	4839.32470703125
perhaps he thought her too young.	4785.919921875
"my dear, dear lydia!"	5398.6103515625
i cannot misunderstand you, but i intreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.	4128.36572265625
it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."	5080.08837890625
mrs. bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together.	4544.90234375
it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."	3886.05615234375
kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia's last
letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	4565.54150390625
"well, well, and so mr. bingley is coming down, sister," (for mrs.
philips first brought her the news.)	4257.50927734375
if elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.	4258.38232421875
"not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing
about it."	3936.801513671875
among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	4514.5810546875
"then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr. bingley to _her_."	5391.78271484375
sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a good
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that
could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight
as the rattle of the chaise.	5635.5625
if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better.	4497.11767578125
"have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"	4396.83154296875
anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her
uncivil.	4374.388671875
when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr. darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent.	4651.3994140625
the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,
which would admit of a chair.	4107.6572265625
"they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!	5249.716796875
they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."	5978.43603515625
it only shews her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."	4889.12744140625
you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous.	4953.443359375
the visit
was returned in due form.	3898.119384765625
she was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	5762.91552734375
they must be a great loss to _your_ family."	4764.6025390625
"indeed i had.	4765.333984375
if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too."	4283.794921875
and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl's younger son?	4403.365234375
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."	4488.23583984375
said she, "i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.	4577.01123046875
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shewn.	5800.5478515625
we had better not mention it.	5498.7451171875
what are men
to rocks and mountains?	5066.85498046875
she
studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.	3801.69091796875
miss bingley said something of his never
     returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.	4819.970703125
upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.	4744.7958984375
resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment; and i
trust i am resigned.	4715.6318359375
"upon my word!--well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as
if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know."	4107.904296875
elizabeth felt jane's
pleasure.	4849.66455078125
"certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	3590.876220703125
"oh, yes!--if one could but go to brighton!	4628.9326171875
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	5110.5556640625
miss bingley was
engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish
to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	3989.304931640625
he had before believed her to return his
     affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--but bingley has
     great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment
     than on his own.--to convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
     himself, was no very difficult point.	5537.80908203125
but vanity, not love, has been my
folly.--pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned.	5129.4326171875
do not let us
quarrel about the past.	5729.3291015625
the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr. darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from
those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love.	5633.515625
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.	4544.6376953125
"probably not;--but mr. darcy can please where he chuses.	5943.009765625
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, "your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say.	5113.890625
but i will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	5136.4423828125
i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully.	4419.79443359375

miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in any
thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.	5050.86669921875
mr. bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.	4072.9130859375
that i had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."	4901.9150390625
elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme,
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.	4561.71142578125
"and i certainly _never_ shall give it.	5300.08740234375
who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly!--i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	4215.80078125
for what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"	5457.1240234375
"i will not trust myself on the subject," replied wickham, "_i_ can
hardly be just to him."	5038.68994140625
my feelings in every respect
forbid it.	5423.0126953125
the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	5013.673828125
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.	4417.31640625
thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women.	4075.35302734375
she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs. collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	4850.31201171875
"in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was."	4664.8017578125
my father is going to
     london with colonel forster instantly, to try to discover her.	5162.29296875
i was uncomfortable enough.	5540.40283203125
but georgiana would not join
her.	4586.62451171875
1813.




pride & prejudice.	4880.54150390625
"yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	5530.76318359375
yes;--there is nothing in that.	4438.48095703125
1.e.9.	5410.6611328125
that _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	4970.5029296875
though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	5286.169921875
has he deigned to add ought of civility to his
ordinary style?	4460.240234375
she is quite a little
creature.	3898.4130859375
but we are all liable to
error.	4471.138671875
"excuse my interference.--it was kindly meant."	3921.430908203125
"thank you," said lydia, "for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be angry."	4265.275390625
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	5211.8994140625
and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion too!	5007.0888671875
mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets.	4306.06494140625
"from mr. collins!	5071.6943359375
in another minute mr. bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	4120.14501953125
she resolved to give her the information herself, and
therefore charged mr. collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner,
to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	4606.82470703125
i am glad he dines here on tuesday.	4531.55029296875
"your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."	4432.21240234375
"yes, very indifferent indeed," said elizabeth, laughingly.	4713.4423828125
"i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long," said miss lucas, "but i
wish he had danced with eliza."	4203.203125
her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.	5206.27587890625
my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--it is
impossible.	4588.1162109375
"depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all."	4764.52490234375
ii.	4677.52490234375
they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet's civilities.	4988.91455078125
their reception from mr. bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial.	4604.20703125
"mrs. collins, you must send a servant with them.	4231.52978515625
"yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be.	4521.306640625
he
     meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
     situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	4155.9580078125
he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; charlotte tried to console her.	4458.34375
he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.	4261.12841796875
elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	4981.37890625
he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	4529.3125
as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go.	4085.778564453125
nobody wants him to come.	4994.70361328125
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."	4030.30615234375
"when is your next ball to be, lizzy?"	5231.66943359375
"read it aloud," said their father, "for i hardly know myself what it is
about."	4415.77490234375
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of
selecting a wife, as i certainly did."	4693.1591796875
1.e.4.	5382.52490234375
he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.	4202.9345703125
"yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--will you hear it?"	4974.76123046875
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity.	5579.896484375
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?"	4691.53466796875
the
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch.	5035.79296875
oh!	4508.11474609375
"haye-park might do," said she, "if the gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off!	4877.77294921875
_i_ only
want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	1347.2889404296875
there was no arguing upon such a project.	4754.552734375
miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	4790.29443359375
her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	4217.1357421875
"i am, dear sir, &c. &c."

mr. gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	4630.26171875
he has
     more to give.	4760.76416015625
collins."	4368.001953125
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than
in charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	4884.671875
the insipidity and yet the noise; the
nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--what would
i give to hear your strictures on them!"	4433.48046875
i do not know the
particulars, but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned, and that
though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
taken himself out of the way.	4284.31005859375
fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	5177.83935546875
"i admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	5220.6298828125
"i thank you for my share of the favour," said elizabeth; "but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."	4536.6962890625
when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister.	5458.69091796875
but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	4443.5546875
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	5448.14892578125
"ah!	5359.08154296875
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- you pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of project gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.	6556.31640625
the reason of this sudden
removal was soon evident.	4521.0263671875
"i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect.	6095.40234375
had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.	4636.48779296875
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	4708.3388671875
bingley urged mr. jones's being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.	4588.544921875
she was gone directly.	4618.86962890625
"i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want."	4732.197265625
my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	5778.6884765625
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	4984.8818359375
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	4634.7236328125
more thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please
than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	4983.6220703125
the others have been gone on to scarborough,
these three weeks."	5356.87890625
the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well
bred and agreeable.	6106.90576171875
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.	4905.06201171875
letters of business too!	6510.6630859375
"not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	4132.29296875
at present i will not say more, but perhaps
when we are better acquainted----"

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.	5106.03515625
1.f.4.	6007.19482421875
were questions with which she amused herself.	4750.2880859375
have you seen any pleasant men?	4310.810546875
he was received by mrs.
bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.	5495.416015625
"i think she will.	5264.70751953125
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	5091.41357421875
"to oblige you, i would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding, than i now do of her heart.	4169.00244140625
and what sort of young lady is she?	4872.779296875
the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.	4607.22900390625
after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr. collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner, though unknown.	4847.1123046875
balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.	4194.41357421875
"it must not be thought of.	4969.43603515625
she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found.	4778.19873046875
she was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks, just fit to be
killed."	4647.0009765625
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming.	4929.43798828125
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.	4916.681640625
they came.	4950.708984375
"oh!	5241.427734375
"believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire.	4719.537109375
we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	4841.38818359375
the business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.	5950.32568359375
but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?"	4986.0703125
the reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as i have given above.	5306.98095703125
she remembered also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr.
darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the
father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	5348.44091796875
what am i to do?"	3980.552734375
he did not
     leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a
     gentleman had called on business.	4064.04345703125
"let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."	3887.85400390625
i promised
them so faithfully!	5255.40234375
but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	4798.185546875
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s.
unless a copyright notice is included.	4629.21533203125
"your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.	4674.3896484375
"at four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said mr. bennet, as he folded up the letter.	4407.61279296875
his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.	4208.794921875
they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the
plain."	4510.08837890625
she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.	7876.16748046875
lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	4163.2451171875
the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.	5036.02392578125
"impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teazing?"	5036.90283203125
but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply
the idea.	5324.9736328125
pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."	4228.34716796875
but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her
misery was considered certain.	4648.8408203125
poor dear
child!	4297.92529296875
he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	4232.2119140625
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."	4919.7490234375
i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister.	4693.6513671875
said elizabeth to herself.--"you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	4370.58154296875
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.	5737.84814453125
her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"	4090.620849609375
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice.	4046.77099609375
for i dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."	4203.744140625
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new
comers.	5107.76904296875
i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable.	4284.412109375
to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs. gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found from her aunt, that pemberley was situated.	4366.48193359375
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate!	4851.884765625
"you are too hasty, sir," she cried.	4253.71484375
mrs. hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.	4564.6796875
oh!	4144.06884765625
you will hardly bear to be
long outdone by jane.	3947.25634765625
she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.	4508.05419921875
my dear jane, mr. collins is
a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well
as i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries
him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	4297.2734375
only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.	5513.689453125
"no," said colonel fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.	5329.8251953125
miss bingley i am sure cannot.	4858.5712890625
in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr. darcy were by no means over.	4646.28759765625
allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that
the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
argument in favour of its propriety."	5967.86328125
mrs. bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.	4049.438720703125
"only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."	4448.5625
the death
     of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	5142.775390625
"i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	4227.3994140625
can there be any other opinion on the subject?"	4297.51123046875
his family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	4502.404296875
she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.	6416.8134765625
good bye.	4319.60888671875
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled.	4471.82958984375
"he likes to have his own way very well," replied colonel fitzwilliam.	4563.9091796875
after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.	3672.5517578125
all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.	4204.6103515625
her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	4605.36669921875
i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen.	4808.318359375
does she live near you, sir?"	5030.19677734375
as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.	3882.040771484375
"do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	5118.08642578125
well, how pleased i am!	5102.12158203125
his countenance, voice, and manner, had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	3570.5068359375
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	4084.52783203125
"your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	4926.19970703125
"yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation!	5127.25146484375
if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.	4851.52880859375
cried elizabeth.	4186.5966796875
towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards myself."	5073.55224609375
chapter vii.	4914.32373046875
but the gloom of lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton.	5796.35595703125
she comes to us to-day.	4665.015625
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.	5160.13232421875
sir william had been
delighted with him.	4820.3017578125
instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--but no,"--recollecting
herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost
to me: i should not have been allowed to invite them."	4783.3642578125
it was to be such a secret!"	4747.2490234375
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself, in their first evening at mr. philips's.	5636.57861328125
sir william staid only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of
her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
with.	4955.68798828125
she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	5138.103515625
i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."	4778.5859375
the former was divided between
admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	4291.01611328125
"you mistake me, my dear.	6009.1884765625
and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.	4349.15576171875
she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	4742.80078125
for forty years, he produced and distributed project
gutenberg-tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.	3738.766357421875
"i mean, that no man in his senses, would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone."	3475.7197265625
many circumstances might make it
     more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
     pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design
     against a young woman of lydia's connections, which is not likely,
     can i suppose her so lost to every thing?--impossible.	5219.4248046875
i am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	5056.22607421875
he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.	4650.259765625
my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect.	4826.0283203125
"yes, indeed," cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.	4415.35400390625
they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended.	3365.95703125
"this is quite shocking!--he deserves to be publicly disgraced."	4611.73046875
"now, kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said mr. bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	4841.3740234375
and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all,
since you went away.	4346.158203125
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	4972.10498046875
"perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh," said
elizabeth.	4563.64794921875
she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	6321.9345703125
it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.	4848.38818359375
but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me."	5232.1982421875
on entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below with a book.	4167.4638671875
it was a large, handsome, stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	5508.1923828125
"_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure," said miss bingley; "and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition."	4317.4716796875
they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.	4226.0048828125
"and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."	5246.20849609375
"may i ask to what these questions tend?"	4477.7568359375
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	4091.963134765625
"all!--what, all five out at once?	3822.0849609375
it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions.	4849.37744140625
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.	5135.27197265625
i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, i am thus rejected.	3933.75390625
"and so ended his affection," said elizabeth impatiently.	4708.75634765625
dearest lizzy, i hardly know what i would
     write, but i have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	4650.98681640625
from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl.	6154.755859375
"indeed, mama, you are mistaken," said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.	4888.17138671875
her performance on the piano-forte is
exquisite."	4749.6806640625
and there was my
aunt, all the time i was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if
she was reading a sermon.	5817.57177734375
the one missent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago.	4806.05810546875
it was reasonable, however, to
hope, that they would not continue long.	4724.93212890625
while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.	4668.5048828125
i shall be back by dinner."	3692.70361328125
there was no want of discourse.	4268.685546875
"then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said mrs.
bennet; "and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle
directly."	4836.1181640625
but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant.	4018.630859375
how he must have felt it!"	5953.94140625
it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and
quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a
mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge, where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	4527.2177734375
lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back.	4605.88037109375
my excellent father
     died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to
     the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it
     to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
     profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a
     valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became
     vacant.	3824.374755859375
she answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."	5766.84619140625
at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs. reynolds
replied, that he was, adding, "but we expect him to-morrow, with a
large party of friends."	4652.41552734375
before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, mrs.
bennet instantly answered,

"oh dear!--yes--certainly.--i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am
sure she can have no objection.--come, kitty, i want you up stairs."	6283.861328125
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family.	4623.5146484375
they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.	4558.77587890625
her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	4756.34423828125
"very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say.	5112.4912109375
you shall not, for the sake of one
individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	3099.11181640625
"there
is nothing the matter with me.	5276.39892578125
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay, as they had been at first.	4865.96728515625
is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring?	4215.2216796875
"and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body."	5409.70654296875
and so, my dear sister, i find from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley."	5548.1806640625
who could have done less for her?	4734.318359375
mrs. long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."	5428.166015625
"very much."	5003.384765625
in lydia's imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness.	4423.3828125
"aye--because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at
being spoke to."	4599.4189453125
"but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."	4986.70751953125
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy.	4620.1298828125
his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	4345.87646484375
mrs. bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr. bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed
how really happy he was.	5285.96337890625
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam.	3511.472412109375
"oh!--your uncle!--he keeps a man-servant, does he?--i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.	4399.62939453125
she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.	4860.021484375
he assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening.	4485.7666015625
elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's.	4399.2685546875
his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	4460.7421875
"how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
year!	4985.9560546875
two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them.	4730.919921875
elizabeth coloured, and said--"a little."	4720.3203125
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of
whom we shall deprive you."	4047.446533203125
after a short pause,
her companion added, "you are too generous to trifle with me.	5538.6962890625
"as i did the other day," said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	4852.65283203125
"_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said mr.
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.	4606.5439453125
when
     she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;
     she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said
     not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
     altered a creature, that when she went away, i was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	4796.6484375
and gravely glancing
at mr. darcy, "there is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
course familiar with--'keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and i
shall keep mine to swell my song."	4332.57177734375
generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself.	6414.623046875
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.	5544.240234375
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	4848.3603515625
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	4866.73291015625
another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment.	4532.76953125
after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.	4187.14404296875
"good gracious!"	3741.359375
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.--he carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by sir
william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear.	4410.1103515625
can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?	4765.24755859375
"i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did.	4948.7216796875
on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them and
told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
make a most important discovery.	4516.7685546875
mrs. collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but mr. collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.	4994.85595703125
painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	3813.42333984375
but, lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it.	5069.2958984375
all that i can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry.	5232.88671875
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits.	5003.265625
i ought not to have said a word about it.	4986.49365234375
not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves.	4630.212890625
"i hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.--and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."	4870.76318359375
"i should never have said mrs. collins
was settled _near_ her family."	4810.0751953125
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	5093.4189453125
and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said,
"she is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.	4503.525390625
she is almost three and twenty!	4896.62109375
"yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	4590.83447265625
so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	5316.017578125
when a woman has
five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
beauty."	4485.50146484375
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs.	4882.0732421875
mr. collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.	5505.38232421875
he
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."	4272.09033203125
you know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.	4533.9453125
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned!	5142.5986328125
his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.	5300.54736328125
how shall i bear so much happiness!"	4118.41259765625
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover.	4994.93212890625
he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	3804.295166015625
we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	5469.0390625
with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."	7399.3837890625
"i certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said darcy,
"of conversing easily with those i have never seen before.	4383.3544921875
"for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr.	4332.69580078125
"yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."	5246.41845703125
their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose
to depart, mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country.	5029.10791015625
and so would anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply.	5312.515625
"i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."	4005.277587890625
lydia's going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there
himself.	4053.789306640625
what will wickham say?	3732.55322265625
let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	4637.04052734375
"he meant, i believe," replied jane, "to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could
be made out from them.	4472.56298828125
sir william, how can you tell such a story?--do not you know
that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?"	4397.837890625
unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	4277.3818359375
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shewn.	4847.6298828125
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten.	4529.46337890625
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and
elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked
of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as
much as possible.	4746.97314453125
every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight.	4417.91455078125
"yes," replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when i first knew her, for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	4586.79931640625
my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can't write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me.	4608.6220703125
i see the imprudence
of it.--oh!	5946.20703125
while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his mornings
to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he
went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin
by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and
dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading
and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which
fronted the road.	5257.97412109375
"what do you mean, hill?	4019.72705078125
much as i respect them, i believe, i thought
only of _you_."	6041.7587890625
he did look at it and into it for half an
hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	3960.14404296875
in meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.	4904.68798828125
"when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other."	4459.77685546875
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.	3781.221923828125
we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon.	5210.52734375
chapter x.


the day passed much as the day before had done.	4334.3076171875
she will be down in a moment i dare say."	5284.7939453125
"i must ask whether you were surprised?"	4395.1796875
recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,

"sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."	4879.4619140625
and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	4140.73486328125
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	4435.81494140625
"he is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived.	4014.279541015625
elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.	4270.126953125
"and lydia used to want to go to london," added kitty.	4743.79150390625
mr. wickham began the subject himself.	5650.615234375
"for we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure, to his kindness.	4351.5869140625
how does georgiana get on, darcy?"	3707.432373046875
bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	3963.07958984375
my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."	5178.0712890625
"that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer."	4550.3193359375
one came from her books, and the other from her
toilette.	4731.66455078125
but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs. bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.	4489.18603515625
elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at all
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	4349.37158203125
but mr. gardiner
     could not be seen, and mr. darcy found, on further enquiry, that
     your father was still with him, but would quit town the next
     morning.	4698.0986328125
she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting.	4991.0654296875
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was
opened, and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it.	4640.0
my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!	4453.55859375
"but it is," returned she; "for mrs. long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."	4916.45654296875
he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.	5248.6357421875
chapter viii.	4492.76220703125
"i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful."	4676.6640625
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.	4448.60498046875
i do think mrs. long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."	4800.77197265625
"not the slightest.	4480.8837890625
i cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at
     all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	5583.595703125
it was gratitude.--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	5160.466796875
my dear hill, have you
heard the good news?	4848.08740234375
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.	5019.26611328125
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.	4194.41357421875
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.	4585.38671875
they may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."	4851.4638671875
she could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	4681.5546875
the express was sent off directly.	4973.3525390625
as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen.	4879.7412109375
special rules,
set forth in the general terms of use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing project gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the project gutenberg-tm concept and trademark.	5180.82763671875
he studies too much for
words of four syllables.--do not you, darcy?"	4935.2802734375
"oh!	4747.26708984375
i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.	4964.62353515625
mr. bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	4159.705078125
"pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried colonel
fitzwilliam.	4787.33935546875
i had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company.	5275.34765625
a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern.	5407.962890625
i was very
uncomfortable, i may say unhappy.	4792.02587890625
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.--others of the party were now applied to.	4881.8310546875
what is the matter?"	4238.7841796875
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away.	5221.884765625
there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.	4485.30029296875
the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced.	5670.1943359375
their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets; and jane more especially,
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must
endure.	3968.317626953125
his revenge would have been complete indeed.	7164.33251953125
mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs. bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	4018.39306640625
elizabeth silently attended
her.	4522.34619140625
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield.	4689.53955078125
i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing!	2829.259033203125
such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said,

"in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.	5498.603515625
"how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains!	3896.327880859375
her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business.	4847.96728515625
chapter iv.	5266.103515625
her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little.	5127.53515625
"so much the better.	4144.6064453125
though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	4545.56103515625
mrs. wickham!	4858.09375
"john told us mr. darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?"	3942.1513671875
under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof
     against the temptation of immediate relief.	5106.7216796875
i want to talk very seriously.	4468.03955078125
mr. collins was eloquent in her praise.	5746.41796875
on saturday he came again.	5197.703125
"it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."	5800.91259765625
console lady catherine as well as
     you can.	5729.8916015625
he begged to know farther particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia, to send any
message to her.	5951.31298828125
the feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	4630.03662109375
but what does he say of the living?"	4849.2802734375
he has the
     promise of an ensigncy in general ----'s regiment, now quartered in
     the north.	3677.30419921875
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.	4383.69287109375
not handsome enough to dance with!	5009.89306640625
"speak to lizzy about it yourself.	4203.6123046875
after this day, jane said no more of her indifference.	4612.59716796875
--said jane as she
finished it.	4539.85546875
"i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.	5019.0888671875
every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	4587.82763671875
i did not think mrs.
gardiner was so little to be trusted."	4534.7626953125
without a governess you must
have been neglected."	5099.98095703125
many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter; i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that i
despair.	3549.97216796875
and on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"the men shan't come and part us, i am determined.	4384.85107421875
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	5370.521484375
first of all, he asked miss lucas.	5312.53125
every thing nourishes what is
strong already.	4753.99072265625
"i shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact
are not your own."	5165.27734375
mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	5064.1015625
and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."	4681.1435546875
"not yet," replied jane.	5589.3818359375
but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief.	4143.666015625
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	4561.990234375
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation
she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed
towards him.	4722.79248046875
"much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."	4507.68896484375
wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	4006.92041015625
then turning to mr. bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.	3888.73291015625
"not so much as i could wish, sir; but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months."	5243.982421875
mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.	4970.77294921875
she was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	4461.21435546875
mrs. gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder.	4890.3212890625
mr. wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family.	4057.72314453125
my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it.	4471.2666015625
in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet's visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.	4355.04541015625
elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of mr. darcy.	4490.37646484375
and
what do you think she said besides?	6077.7275390625
she does not yet leave her dressing-room.	4755.77734375
with such rivals for the notice of the fair, as mr. wickham and the
officers, mr. collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the
young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a
kind listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most
abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	4310.66650390625
by reading or using any part of this project gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

(trademark/copyright) agreement.	6328.52734375
"your affectionate friend,

     "lydia bennet."	4735.79541015625
they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.	4830.54541015625
since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was
only exceedingly shy.	5600.51220703125
"i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."	4974.974609375
now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"	4514.8740234375
it is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	6389.224609375
"yes, she will remain there till christmas."	4440.72900390625
"is miss darcy much grown since the spring?"	5004.76416015625
you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!	5394.99755859375
the strangeness of mr. collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being
now accepted.	4763.9482421875
there is no danger of wickham's marrying mary king.	3457.796875
"mama," cried lydia, "my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke's library."	4923.6494140625
if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."	4889.1083984375
"she is my youngest girl but one.	5675.09033203125
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they shewed for jane.	4813.70947265625
it is because he will not give himself the trouble."	4323.28125
it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	4737.1865234375
mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	3254.90478515625
"yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise."	4324.951171875
where, where is my uncle?"	4715.6005859375
"and then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be able to tell
what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	5135.86962890625
every body is disgusted with his pride.	4194.41357421875
"and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.	4237.478515625
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.	4682.18408203125
he is come--mr. bingley is
come.--he is, indeed.	4152.3369140625
but it was not to be.	4645.1533203125
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.	4197.48291015625
mr. bingley arrived.	4519.22900390625
"you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	5931.6396484375
"oh!	3840.3427734375
tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."	4116.833984375
elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up
stairs together.	4449.7080078125
he resigned all
     claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could
     ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
     thousand pounds.	5089.02490234375
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.	4599.138671875
where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?	5645.169921875
"i know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	4872.03125
"my dear, dear lizzy, i would--i do congratulate you--but are you
certain?	5056.8720703125
"no, that i am sure i shall not; and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	6091.0791015625
i have
not the smallest hope.	5698.861328125
"i must not decide on my own performance."	4840.72314453125
with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.--the envelope itself was likewise
full.--pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	5074.26806640625
elizabeth blushed
and blushed again with shame and vexation.	4198.92822265625
i wish you had been there.	5081.8037109375
every kind of pride must revolt from the
connection.	3906.086669921875
"having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:
of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	4004.834716796875
she went on.	5899.44384765625
and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty.	4323.541015625
"how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr. darcy," she cried; "i
never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	4062.950439453125
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth, which spoke her distress at
such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	4491.0185546875
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.	5363.544921875
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede.	5366.8505859375
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	4745.21240234375
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."	5117.2958984375
she
must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	5332.255859375
"lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use.	4805.875
"because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."	4938.3310546875
while in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family!	4659.0888671875
no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.	4898.18115234375
"in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere.	4261.77490234375
you must write again very
     soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	5300.7392578125
i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	4965.703125
"if your master would marry, you might see more of him."	4628.2880859375
but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is.	4718.8212890625
you need not.	4835.47705078125
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with
how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be
renewed.	5849.53857421875
with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	4639.70751953125
he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him."	4232.5146484375
but if i go on, i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem.	4826.1435546875
mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe's
calling yesterday to thank me?	4771.0498046875
"i know little of the game, at present," said he, "but i shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" mrs. philips was
very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	5598.7978515625
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before.	4437.27880859375
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	4028.622802734375
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.	4158.90380859375
"our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."	6147.79833984375
colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings.	5529.0068359375
of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!	5007.3134765625
chapter i.


miss bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	4369.47705078125
section 1.  general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.a.	4369.1728515625
my dear mr. bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	5049.24365234375
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.	5036.6435546875
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know, and read great
books, and make extracts."	4147.85693359375
"which do you mean?"	3300.8408203125
nor was darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	4696.6962890625
she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	4152.8916015625
i am afraid you will not be able to make
     it out, but i hardly know what i have written."	4300.69677734375
she is
a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will _make_ her know it."	4860.85595703125
he made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton.	4659.19970703125
after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."	5546.5673828125
her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her
mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in
the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	4169.75390625
"if!	4341.021484375
lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over.	4288.3935546875
i write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
     myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both,
     cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation,
     and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
     spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	5282.833984375
it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,

"how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!	4577.62255859375
"you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.--are you much acquainted with mr.	5960.24755859375
i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to any one less worthy."	4563.1171875
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged.	4100.130859375
thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose
to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room.	5285.4443359375
haggerston has our directions, and
     all will be completed in a week.	4864.0927734375
"no; but it must be done soon."	4863.3876953125
"let her be called down.	4794.0556640625
by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.	3912.484375
in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected
conversation.--"oh!	4063.9619140625
she was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
surprise.--that she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs.
hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her
in contempt for it.	3988.4072265625
your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."	3709.759521484375
the old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who lives with them.	4680.4697265625
for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	4697.9912109375
- you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of project gutenberg-tm works.	4900.923828125
it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	4257.5458984375
his disposition must
be dreadful."	4877.763671875
"upon my word," said mrs. gardiner, "i begin to be of your uncle's
opinion.	4324.947265625
they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, every thing
to him.	4612.57080078125
on distinguishing the ladies of the group,
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.	4727.34814453125
you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."	4837.48828125
"what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"	4424.93115234375
he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases.	4105.2646484375
"i am not one and twenty."	4654.4658203125
"lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."	5683.40966796875
but
of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom
could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings,
afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house.	4958.20751953125
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret.	4513.15625
i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion
for any thing more.	4310.95458984375
"that is a question which i hardly know how to answer.	4743.2666015625
after
lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking
that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn,
and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though
he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have
two full courses.	4107.14794921875
"she did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."	3882.040771484375
we were
married, you know, at st. clement's, because wickham's lodgings were in
that parish.	4408.70556640625
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	3576.955078125
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield.	4983.8408203125
the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,

"are you pleased with kent?"	5092.9482421875
"i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretension whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	3855.28515625
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued
the subject, by saying, "but tell me all and every thing about it, which
i have not already heard.	4174.7197265625
he took the hint, and soon began with, "this seems a very comfortable
house.	4291.27783203125
cried elizabeth.	4930.32666015625
"_that_ you certainly shall."	4616.02490234375
he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	4968.9765625
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	5768.595703125
they were in ----
     street.	3931.972412109375
elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	4671.626953125
if i may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."	5724.16259765625
they
followed her into the dining-parlour.	3889.3818359375
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.	4134.9140625
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.	4565.650390625
she declared her resolution.	4581.7802734375
he
is so excessively handsome!	4738.6865234375
i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother
lady catherine.	4199.0166015625
mr.
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	4194.41357421875
he was full of joy and
attention.	5225.8251953125
"another time, lizzy," said her mother, "i would not dance with _him_,
if i were you."	5224.25537109375
she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	5320.6787109375
i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire."	4759.27978515625
when this was
done, she had a less active part to play.	5118.21826171875
its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	5058.77734375
mrs. bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone mr. collins began.	4756.4033203125
"oh!	4551.14794921875
the first part of mrs. gardiner's business on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	4258.8818359375
"but my father cannot.--he wrote last week to hurry my return."	4638.38037109375
he did trace them easily to
     clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed
     into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them
     from epsom.	4288.34033203125
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr. wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.	4417.89794921875
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.	4464.11279296875
almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life.	6040.91796875
"but i can assure you," she added, "that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.	4672.6025390625
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	4462.79296875
but, really, i know not what to say.	4838.29541015625
mr. collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.	4288.0830078125
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	5502.474609375
he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.	5928.6484375
i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner.	4904.12646484375
and who knows what _may_ happen?	4258.7275390625
"i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."	5001.810546875
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	4457.26806640625
chapter iii.	4502.6962890625
that the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny.	5031.67431640625
"dearest jane!	5548.14892578125
bennet.--they had several children.	4773.662109375
and his
answering immediately to the last question--oh!	5357.27734375
_she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	4537.873046875
pray do not talk of that odious man.	4530.6904296875
and if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."	4600.52880859375
she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	1409.8980712890625
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	4437.21533203125
my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other.	4154.12744140625
miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.	5364.685546875
what are you telling miss bennet?	5766.0380859375
people _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true.	4919.3173828125
"if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to
his friend within a few days," she added, "i shall know how to
understand it.	4366.7275390625
his debts are to be paid,
     amounting, i believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,
     another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased.	4692.443359375
bingley."	5497.5439453125
"it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."	4609.7958984375
"he is also handsome," replied elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can.	1371.7232666015625
she dared not relate the other
half of mr. darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by his friend.	4819.66259765625
"i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing.	4659.435546875
said her aunt.	5173.9296875
"with the officers!"	5341.37109375
you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came here
with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i be
dissuaded from it.	5520.55078125
what could she mean by
it?	4455.9248046875
never mind miss
lizzy's hair."	4848.82275390625
gardiner."	4475.7333984375
of course, we hope that you will support the project
gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing project gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.	5437.09814453125
if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have
ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	5166.720703125
but slyness seems the fashion.	4264.79541015625
"removed!"	5642.85546875
not that _i_ think
charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."	4810.50146484375
while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.	4632.8232421875
"from what we have seen of him," continued mrs. gardiner, "i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
any body, as he has done by poor wickham.	6100.7587890625
as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.--every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.	5125.80419921875
"this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy.	4890.72216796875
"a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.	4058.01708984375
"none at all.	4730.3291015625
you alluded to something else.	3959.29443359375
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you.	4519.89697265625
why was he to be the judge?"	5313.666015625
a person may be
proud without being vain.	4955.8720703125
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	4976.796875
"he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."	4632.5361328125
but, perhaps his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."	4228.6376953125
that had
his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as mr. bingley, was incomprehensible.	4301.72216796875
"if it was to be secret," said jane, "say not another word on the
subject.	4090.168212890625
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	4396.9072265625
when the first
transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were
over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	4888.4326171875
observed mrs. bennet.	5311.98388671875

you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you."	3954.86767578125
the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr.	4218.53125
poor lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful.	5148.40380859375
but against this, there were objections; and she finally
resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as
to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	3612.849853515625
mrs. philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs. philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	4386.73779296875
i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."	4696.23046875
she mentioned this to her friend miss
lucas.	4971.10009765625
"lizzy, you must not do so.	5405.884765625
"i advise mr. darcy, and lizzy, and kitty," said mrs. bennet, "to walk
to oakham mount this morning.	4243.65380859375
my youngest of all, is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,
who i believe will soon become a part of the family."	4846.94580078125
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years
ago.	5030.50341796875
are quite well."	5564.2255859375
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly
calm.--elizabeth's courage did not fail her.	3834.98095703125
but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."	4481.43115234375
had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."	3058.0966796875
"very well.	3548.3271484375
i am
afraid you will be angry."	4504.2294921875
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.	4948.56103515625
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	5093.33154296875
i will only add, god bless you.	3880.5009765625
she began at length to recover, to
fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
herself.	4808.2587890625
my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out.	4293.23046875
"yes, ma'am, all."	4726.8837890625
she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her."	5455.89599609375
she had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in
a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy, she moved again towards the
gate.	4631.228515625
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of mr. darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.	4546.3330078125
"yes; he introduced us to his sister."	7147.0263671875
the faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change
was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or
the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given
something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of kitty.	3774.64306640625
"that is very strange.	3986.5400390625
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
was her only alternative.	3935.79541015625
this room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then.	5170.2060546875
lord, how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty!	1375.7852783203125
lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	4757.93212890625
"no, indeed, i did not.--i knew nothing at all of lady catherine's
connections.	5584.61328125
does your
charge give you much trouble?	3968.079345703125
it was all conjecture."	5486.01123046875
*       *       *       *       *

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs. bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour, and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.	4870.619140625
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved."	4761.0185546875
he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"	3832.736083984375
darcy."	4509.765625
you know not, you
can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some
time, i confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice."	5010.33251953125
how he lived i know not.	5122.7890625
"yes, very different.	4360.85546875
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"is not this nice?	5022.42626953125
i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.	4439.6748046875
but there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbad the disclosure.	4940.978515625
and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much.	4589.83642578125
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to
the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the
door.	4781.2392578125
"it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane," said she.	4708.73828125
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	4913.76611328125
occupied in observing mr. bingley's attentions to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.	4407.29736328125
you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."	4920.45751953125
was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table.	4207.55859375
from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce.	4324.873046875
nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the united states.	4405.79736328125
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.	4346.03369140625
"i am astonished," said miss bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.--what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr.	5296.4287109375
she was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.	4447.38720703125
you shall hear what she says."	5592.42626953125
when the ladies removed after dinner, elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	4650.375
that he is
as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."	4060.85498046875
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home.	4759.72021484375
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by
an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	4789.3671875
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could
     so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
     seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	4682.197265625
this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.	4663.2451171875
secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps i ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation
of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness.	5059.2119140625
you know i have.	7357.20751953125
he generously imputed the whole to his
     mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath
     him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	5332.8251953125
but with _me_, it is not so.	4777.26953125
the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--oh!	4616.1220703125
"miss bennet i am shocked and astonished.	5069.494140625
i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement.	3910.61181640625
if you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of project gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	3906.146484375
every thing being settled between _them_, mr. darcy's next step was
     to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
     gracechurch-street the evening before i came home.	4890.0830078125
only think!	5656.32470703125
only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"	4697.650390625
but
my dearest love, tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond of,
that i may have it to-morrow."	5533.89208984375
on being made acquainted with the
present mr. darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree
with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard
mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured
boy.	4332.62548828125
but still he would be her husband.--without thinking highly
either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it
was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small
fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their
pleasantest preservative from want.	4194.41357421875
"well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "i have no more to
say.	4414.427734375
"yes, yes, they must marry.	4205.8779296875
chapter xx.	4383.0576171875
"you shall have it in few words.	4290.78662109375
he had to be sure done much.	4192.6220703125
"we have heard only once.	4590.51025390625
people do not die of little
trifling colds.	5632.32275390625
"oh!	4821.1845703125
as a clergyman, moreover, i
     feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
     all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds
     i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly
     commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
     entail of longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side,
     and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	4610.15625
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get
the better of himself.	4380.07421875
there is a lady, it seems, a
     mrs. younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what.	4594.2373046875
"i want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about mr. wickham.	4899.1201171875
"why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."	4990.3994140625
the officer was the very
mr. denny, concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire,
and he bowed as they passed.	5186.1962890625
heaven and earth!--of what
are you thinking?	4320.103515625
this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	4184.26171875
my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy!	4056.771240234375
when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn.	4292.3173828125
at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the
head quarters.	4760.01953125
and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady catherine) had only
set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked
forward to as possible, at some future time.	4986.5361328125
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.	4833.4208984375
can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?"	4522.66943359375
his
attachment to rosings, certainly increases."	4291.4169921875
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty's and
lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	4194.1015625
would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	4669.43994140625
"well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
say you to the day?	4261.55908203125
mr. collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,

"it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.	5082.4140625
i should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off.	4613.6748046875
the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour's tête-à-tête with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on.--"as to
her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."	3822.3037109375
i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so.	4967.96240234375
he dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again
     on wednesday or thursday.	4908.2392578125
no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr. collins in time."	5466.71875
every body said how well
she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.	5895.65869140625
"yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it."	4652.45068359375
she
would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.	4263.95361328125
"that is very true," said elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before.	3589.201904296875
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one card
table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
the first.	5311.5126953125
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr. bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on.	4751.8740234375
we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.	4249.27490234375
mr. what's his name.	4421.3876953125
i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	5488.54931640625
how i should like to be married before any of you; and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls.	4893.60546875
my father and mother believe the worst,
     but i cannot think so ill of him.	5547.884765625
till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.	4959.97607421875
"and will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"	4851.46826171875
he readily agreed to it.	4691.63330078125
you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.	4978.8525390625
wretched, wretched, mistake!"	4989.119140625
what a fine thing for our girls!"	4245.52001953125
"you begin to comprehend me, do you?"	4356.17529296875
mrs. bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	4372.82421875
when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	4656.685546875
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--mr.	3756.81591796875
'lady
catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'	4731.6240234375
"was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?"	4488.7578125
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	4194.41357421875
"it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_."	6162.08544921875
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"let me call your maid.	4107.7236328125
but that is not the
case _here_.	5007.80078125
if you love mr. darcy half as well as i do my dear
     wickham, you must be very happy.	4001.982666015625
make
haste, and come down this moment."	4536.8388671875
"i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	5771.8916015625
she saw all the glories of the camp; its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.	4473.67626953125
"oh!	4645.3349609375
i could hardly keep my countenance.	4473.15576171875
it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	4039.783935546875
his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips.	4470.861328125
"some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know."	5063.52197265625
pemberley was now georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see.	6148.93603515625
"yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	4590.52783203125

in spite of having been at st. james's, sir william was so completely
awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	4670.375
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.	4300.1142578125
his belief of her sister's
insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of
the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have
any wish of doing him justice.	4669.212890625
"my father and maria are to come to me in march," added charlotte, "and
i hope you will consent to be of the party.	5394.36962890625

what do
you keep winking at me for?	4924.25537109375
indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them."	4730.1484375
"'tis too much!"	4316.4423828125
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all
the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her
sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case,
was almost incredible!	3449.52001953125
allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.	4822.3291015625
her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of mr. darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	4940.7099609375
how was that possible?	4510.79833984375
you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."	5389.25341796875
lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance.	4377.11376953125
"to jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection.	4845.1708984375
"lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	5237.68505859375
i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the
subject."	5453.57080078125
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore, stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care.	4287.33837890625
mr. bennet could not have chosen
better.	5551.1181640625
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room.	5017.82080078125
your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come."	4779.9990234375
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	4747.8740234375
colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr. darcy they had
only seen at church.	4037.657958984375
charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	4786.61376953125
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.	4985.10498046875
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.	4787.275390625
"i never saw a more promising inclination.	4686.7275390625
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	4934.8564453125
and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,
after they are married.	4489.18603515625
by many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	4664.26806640625
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.	4259.466796875
mr. jones says we must not think of moving her.	5047.693359375
in this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	3997.855224609375
both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.	4050.423583984375
in the former were many good paintings;
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.	5414.9814453125
but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to
me!--they were excessively sorry to go!	4881.6171875
chapter viii.	4542.939453125
that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr. bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings.	5396.59765625
mr. bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him.	4848.4111328125
"and how impossible in others!"	4671.90283203125
his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure."	4501.6787109375
elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.	5336.630859375
darcy!--and so it does i vow.	8220.7734375
said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it."	5332.4130859375
of having another daughter married to mr. collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	6792.044921875
"what think you of books?"	5057.412109375
but it is so
strange!"	6347.416015625
to catherine and lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.	3980.0517578125
mr. wickham's chief object was unquestionably my
     sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot
     help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a
     strong inducement.	4462.04833984375
elizabeth read on; "i have seen them both.	5085.99755859375
"no governess!	4547.18701171875
no,
no--i feel he may defy us there.	4198.29150390625
"is my father in town?"	4839.9521484375
as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	5074.06494140625
a thousand things may arise in six months!"	5309.23388671875
you are lucky in
having such a master."	5993.33544921875
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any
one; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself."	4006.676025390625
is not it so, mrs.	4458.5732421875
this mrs.
     younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	4325.3349609375
she had a sister married to a mr. philips, who had been a clerk to their
father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.	5447.43701171875
she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony
was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it
possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every
better feeling to worldly advantage.	5211.640625
that he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest
opinion.	5882.35400390625
you must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     project gutenberg-tm works.	4484.5859375
their society can afford no pleasure,
that will atone for such wretchedness as this!	6839.41015625
it is a nice long walk, and mr. darcy has
never seen the view."	5326.94921875
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley's
way."	3254.22509765625
"we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said mrs.
gardiner, "but perhaps to the lakes."	6691.3876953125
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.	4496.54736328125
the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"	4613.23046875
i am most seriously displeased."	5264.02978515625
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.	4693.51708984375
but will they make you happy?"	4194.41357421875
her ladyship was highly incensed.	4753.0703125
oh, sister!	4067.339111328125
what do i not
owe you!	5482.0732421875
"my dear, dear
aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight!	5466.09326171875
lydia's intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr. collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr. bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr. collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford.	5589.05126953125
why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight?	4336.10205078125
arguments are too much like disputes.	3995.0654296875
"oh!	4105.23681640625
i am so happy.	5423.224609375
"it is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.	4754.07666015625
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.	4627.28173828125
nothing could be more delightful!	3871.201171875
i told my sister philips so the other day.	5350.03271484375
two days after mr. bennet's return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, "i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask."	5787.55126953125
is _her_ husband, is the son of
his late father's steward, to be his brother?	4886.45654296875
"i wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."	4495.466796875
"a place too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected.	3762.692626953125
miss bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.	4665.30029296875
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.	4697.9462890625
"i should not be surprised," said darcy, "if he were to give it up, as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."	4258.9384765625
he expressed no regret for what he had
done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	4761.849609375
"perhaps i do.	5024.3857421875
their eyes
were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers,
and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin
in a shop window, could recal them.	3742.590576171875
mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire.	4345.54052734375
"a little."	4861.759765625
i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful."	4388.34033203125
on reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	4958.4912109375
there
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."	4719.52783203125
it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who, when i am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	5537.6298828125
she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley.	4626.07275390625
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."	4819.21240234375
at length, she spoke again.	4497.2763671875
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."	4407.71337890625
well, i was so frightened i did not
know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond
the hour, we could not be married all day.	5126.8017578125
nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant.	4161.41943359375
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	4986.77880859375
you have delighted us long enough.	4499.5498046875
mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--though lydia had
never been a favourite with them, mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be
deeply affected.	5216.4345703125
mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance,
and when immediately before my father's death, mr. darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."	4234.4326171875
don't think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
     that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side.	4729.76953125
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr. darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage.	4748.208984375
"or in other words, you are determined to have him.	6076.69580078125
indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not."	3920.68310546875
and so did mrs.
forster.	4377.95703125
"that is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare.	5109.123046875
a flirt too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	4511.83056640625
at such a time, much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward.	5270.4599609375
"you are uniformly charming!"	4865.81396484375
at length however mrs. bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	4356.478515625
her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	6626.31591796875
"and this," cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me!	4217.28857421875
"you are quite a visit in my debt, mr. bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned.	5126.36181640625
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object.	4887.47705078125
she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.	5009.2333984375

it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.	4712.2958984375
their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	4550.99609375
and what can _he_ have to say?"	4194.41357421875

1.e.2.	5001.4912109375
do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart."	4390.45849609375
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood.	4482.28564453125
cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."	5073.3974609375
did he know of
their intending to go off?	4966.025390625
"who do you mean, my dear?	4659.208984375
family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what
his father was, have done this.	4968.35595703125
"oh!	4761.25
"the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	4757.255859375
she was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by wickham.	4526.66552734375
my dear mr. bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of?	4198.748046875
and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	5557.400390625
georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	4371.36083984375
and with a bow to mr. darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--many
stared.--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet
himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having
spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that
he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.	4010.043701171875
i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so i do still at my heart;
and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel
forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william's in his
regimentals."	4506.580078125
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	4891.3984375
the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies.	4388.892578125
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects.	4556.78076171875
i did not know before, that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony.	5649.8662109375
"and you saw him frequently?"	5167.2578125
but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years.	4880.4580078125
your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,
may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land."	5339.99609375
the
gentlemen did approach; and when mr. wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	4005.7705078125
they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	4480.7939453125
as they went down stairs together, charlotte said,

"i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza."	5538.3056640625
elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley's invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the archbishop, or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.	5274.6630859375
pray, how _violent was_ mr. bingley's
love?"	5084.484375
at present we
have nothing to guide us.	3564.42724609375
his sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had
always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.	4685.44921875
but he is an ugly fellow!	5020.8173828125
no.--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."	4791.28564453125
well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done."	4407.72607421875
my mind was more
agreeably engaged.	4089.236083984375
"implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.	5125.10546875
"you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
which i have never acknowledged.	4580.60498046875
"i am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	5970.3681640625
it would be dreadful!	6212.7080078125
mr. bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to
look at netherfield house.	6099.58935546875
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end.	5347.7421875
chapter v.


every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	4543.4072265625
"she is a great deal too ill to be
moved.	4688.55126953125
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	3696.900390625
"oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"	4265.68212890625
your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	4240.7734375
you must contrive to send
somebody.	5684.201171875
who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"	4949.25048828125
this was invitation enough.	4336.56494140625
i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town."	5695.921875
there is but one part of my conduct in the
     whole affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is
     that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
     conceal from him your sister's being in town.	5070.8046875
chapter xiv.	4991.00830078125
"i am sick of mr. bingley," cried his wife.	5041.34326171875
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	5330.5625
"who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"	4967.68310546875
lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good humoured as lydia.	5730.3671875
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia,
depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
they each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr.
wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and
a ball was at any rate, a ball.	5154.05859375
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance.	5134.052734375
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him.	4957.1103515625
he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.	4519.3408203125
the lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister.	4883.2421875
by nature inoffensive,
friendly and obliging, his presentation at st. james's had made him
courteous.	4437.62158203125
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at longbourn.	4809.6435546875
on both sides it was only assertion.	4346.8876953125
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	4120.396484375
mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.	4495.6767578125
to this, mary very gravely replied, "far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.	3532.07421875
their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	4578.91943359375
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs.
philips's manners and politeness.	4669.29296875
she respected, she
esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	4400.05712890625
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.	4822.11328125
"but surely," said she, "i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."	4907.16748046875
mr. wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	5009.859375
"well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him.	4613.07666015625
he replied, and was again silent.	4579.8798828125
she found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short
pause, added,

"i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?"	4696.2978515625
it soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that
jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she
had ever known before.	5029.86572265625
mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	4859.6044921875
"upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person.--pray, what is your age?"	4923.1142578125
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	4581.806640625
it was as
follows:

     "my dear sir,

     "i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from hertfordshire.	4243.2734375
charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say.	4446.560546875
darcy.--she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that
should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever
happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a
favourite haunt of hers.--how it could occur a second time therefore was
very odd!--yet it did, and even a third.	5032.18310546875
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.	5208.86328125
cried elizabeth when she had
finished it.	5412.080078125
lydia left a few lines for his wife,
     informing her of their intention.	5066.5458984375
"mrs. annesley is with her.	3982.960205078125
he
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	4658.16455078125
"we are not in a way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."	5514.5205078125
"true," said mr. bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always
make the most of it."	5658.6611328125
my brother admires her greatly already, he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart.	4399.4111328125
again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	4763.77978515625
"you may as well call it impertinence at once.	4648.5615234375
"beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse miss darcy," replied jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	4210.533203125
"the first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
in company with either of them.	4428.595703125
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting, that had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been.	4722.60302734375
"sure he
will not leave london before he has found them.	4600.515625
"of what are you talking?"	4423.779296875
well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now.	5518.9873046875
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	4827.88330078125
it is just as he chooses.	4928.6201171875
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters.	5048.4013671875
wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in
     london, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her.	5005.26513671875
cried he, turning towards her.	4326.45703125
"but, my dear elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is miss king?	5146.8134765625
when the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party.	4526.734375
"where is your sister?"	4522.2685546875
"no, my dear; i think not.	4649.32373046875
"i have an excessive regard for jane bennet, she is really a very sweet
girl, and i wish with all my heart she were well settled.	4416.3896484375
the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence.	5646.7041015625
their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around
them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering
place and a camp.	4891.58056640625
certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
any thing to deserve to lose it.	4751.357421875
is not he a charming man?	5673.888671875
with a glance she saw,
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	4299.93798828125
they repulsed
every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	4799.7373046875
i think i have heard you say that you know them."	4806.1455078125
they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle, driving up the street.	4385.5791015625
see
paragraph 1.c below.	4626.474609375
it is not quite a week since they left brighton.	5298.4296875
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him,
there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.	4478.34619140625
from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	5518.85546875
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time.	4534.732421875
jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline.	4762.3447265625
widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.--how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?--he declared himself to have been totally
unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help
remembering what charlotte's opinion had always been.--neither could she
deny the justice of his description of jane.--she felt that jane's
feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a
constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.	4692.26416015625
the more i see
of the world, the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.	4155.625
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	5373.580078125
"when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--oh!	4894.2587890625
and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner."	5006.1484375
wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	4751.810546875
the general prejudice against mr. darcy is so violent,
that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton, to
attempt to place him in an amiable light.	4585.22509765625
they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,

"but is there not danger of lady catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir?--you had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of
offending your patroness."	4337.7685546875
it has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor.	5389.21728515625
he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.	4840.56640625
well, much good may it do them!	4818.7529296875
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.	4417.83447265625
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.	4882.64599609375
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	4631.2021484375
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer.	4916.99560546875
teaze him--laugh at
him.--intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."	4453.240234375
all
elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she
still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her
again.	4723.00390625
the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.	5031.880859375
jane looked at her doubtingly.	5043.81005859375
we now come to the point.	4831.439453125
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn.	4553.40576171875
i have therefore made up my mind to tell
you, that i do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."	4695.07080078125
but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	4510.86279296875
"if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,"
said mrs. bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for."	4782.3427734375
"miss bingley told me," said jane, "that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.	4271.27978515625
on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."	4379.61474609375
_hunsford, near westerham, kent,

     15th october._

     dear sir,

     the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father, always gave me much uneasiness, and since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach; but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing
     lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good
     terms with any one, with whom it had always pleased him to be at
     variance.--"there, mrs.	4438.98876953125
"what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr.	5003.2177734375
"from the very beginning, from the first moment i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry."	4421.1767578125
"i have already told her so once, by your desire."	4529.0576171875
_we_ were always good friends;
and now we are better."	5127.6669921875
if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all."	4288.79443359375
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.	4824.39013671875
but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	7023.283203125
_too
much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject?	4483.453125
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
in darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.	3941.771728515625
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	4688.55615234375
but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."	5574.1044921875
"if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	4915.875
i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham's character."	6207.6025390625
but when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	4775.1787109375
my sisters may write to _me_.	4525.9228515625
then addressing her daughter, "oh!	4614.07080078125
i had not
believed it possible."	5340.6328125
"i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	3857.3740234375
and then when we came away it was such fun!	3440.541015625
"they have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."	4987.6826171875
chapter ii.	4717.30517578125
you have shewn him off now much
more than he did himself."	5072.91357421875
this
however was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.	5142.6083984375
you must send john with
the young ladies, mrs. collins.	5044.19482421875
girls, can i do any
thing for you in meryton?	4547.67724609375
it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."	4761.79052734375
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	4768.70263671875
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of
thing.--young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life.	5583.2607421875
thank heaven!	4392.46875
these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i with greater policy
concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being
impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by every thing.	3820.743896484375
she was
sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	4893.32080078125
"i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	4094.08642578125
he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy.	5252.08056640625
in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her.	4541.609375
he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.	5556.42529296875
i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.	4126.73583984375
there was
novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.	5053.912109375
"except," thought elizabeth, "when she goes to ramsgate."	4949.5146484375
scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but
their visit to rosings.	4835.69384765625
it is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	4290.74560546875
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.	4083.84619140625
said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam.	4026.40673828125
mr. darcy!	3225.0166015625
their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.	4366.31103515625
"i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man."	4225.5498046875
nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	5242.322265625
and one of my
own daughters.	4755.1787109375
"i am astonished, my dear," said mrs. bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.	5109.0888671875
the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do."	5187.5908203125
but mr. gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	4581.10302734375
i know it to be impossible."	4634.33935546875
nor was it under many, many minutes, that
she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to
credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them.	5066.89404296875
she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.	4730.76220703125
"what is it you mean?"	5477.615234375
"you may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time.	6088.8486328125
cried maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but
a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have
happened!"	4429.8076171875
she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley.	4973.072265625
four nieces
of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day, that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.	4661.83984375
kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	5582.201171875
mrs. bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."	5273.154296875
but perhaps," added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	4919.3125
"i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	5250.8984375
she cried.	4671.25244140625
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	6209.74609375
we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster's.	4362.166015625
after making
     every possible enquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into
     hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at
     the inns in barnet and hatfield, but without any success, no such
     people had been seen to pass through.	5185.904296875
we do not suffer by _accident_.	4354.4140625
these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.	4274.75146484375
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments.	4365.986328125
in town i believe he chiefly lived, but his
     studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
     restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	4558.884765625
that will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at
table for him."	4869.14697265625
must it be so?"	4895.916015625
they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound.	5149.07177734375
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	4472.490234375
he danced only
four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge,
more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	4441.5634765625
"but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."	4597.80517578125
they can
only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."	6054.0732421875
but, though
this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour
to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival of jane.	4382.802734375
i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	4022.35009765625
not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there
seemed a gulf impassable between them.	4373.4833984375
"gracechurch-street, sept. 6.	4124.96142578125
a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."	3689.82763671875
at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her.	3590.876220703125
"i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	5763.8994140625
has she any family?"	5266.9072265625
elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little.	4774.52734375
in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the
sight of each other.	4430.23876953125
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	4042.10009765625
but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.	4334.74169921875
he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."	4718.6728515625
by the author of "sense and sensibility."	5249.41162109375
is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	4791.390625
and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose?	4702.03857421875
you
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr. wickham's
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be.	4156.7666015625
"i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."	4819.7822265625
she would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house."	5586.1953125
you will be a very happy woman."	5580.73193359375
mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr. denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant's
commission in the ----shire.	4226.859375
her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	4506.29638671875
elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	4734.41796875
"oh!"	4916.71435546875
she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	5226.119140625
this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	5058.4833984375
"i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	4297.3759765625
he had never had the
slightest suspicion.	4752.28173828125
"it is more than i engage for, i assure you."	4737.10498046875
"i deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried elizabeth; "i am
_not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things."	4942.3076171875
"yes.	5563.39794921875
i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put
it off, and then i should have gone quite distracted.	4882.68798828125
you supposed more than
     really existed.	5506.3486328125
young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer.	5335.77587890625
"la!	4834.5732421875
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and
the children.	5525.1328125
darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.	4350.02685546875
elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	5038.21923828125
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	4506.64892578125
"i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle.	4408.26025390625
"and do you impute it to either of those?"	4553.8310546875
"your friend performs delightfully;" he
continued after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group;--"and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr.	5484.98095703125
i will read it to you--

"when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	5689.02734375
your mother insists upon your
accepting it.	4904.271484375
"indeed i could not.	4031.5322265625
i am glad it occurred to me to mention
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	4602.88134765625
lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	4086.113525390625
"i am not now to learn," replied mr. collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.	4585.294921875
amazed at the
alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life.	5081.84228515625
mr. bennet protested against any
description of finery.	5507.6669921875
"but upon my honour i do _not_.	4350.40869140625
it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."	5183.11083984375
what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."	4440.923828125
it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever.	4694.8740234375
he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.	5271.51025390625
"i can answer your question," said fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him.	5060.4033203125
did you see it?"	5660.6689453125
mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
it.	4682.72900390625
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.	5438.7216796875
but on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away.	4843.7294921875
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.	3979.410400390625
he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of
all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.	5925.40380859375
in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
affection than she feels.	3649.626708984375
it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!	5626.857421875
"i have just had a letter from
jane, with such dreadful news.	4406.21337890625
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	4620.51318359375
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	4966.56494140625
her reflections were
in general satisfactory.	4317.48828125
she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia, and, removed from the influence of lydia's example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid.	4722.09423828125
"indeed!"	6078.2724609375
bingley
was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be pleased.	5234.0048828125
here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
last incumbrance of mystery.	3963.438720703125
the colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken.	4554.5654296875
about a year ago, she was taken from
     school, and an establishment formed for her in london; and last
     summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to ramsgate;
     and thither also went mr. wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there
     proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs.
     younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by
     her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to georgiana,
     whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his
     kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
     herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	4640.66796875
so tall!--oh, my
dear lizzy!	4483.49560546875
she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing
else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	4532.25927734375
i will have no reserves from _you_."	4400.9384765625
i quite forgot!	4622.580078125
i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world, where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.	5698.291015625
darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	5499.001953125
do let me ask my partner to introduce you."	4587.21484375
"yes, he went on tuesday as i wrote you word."	5572.86572265625
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm
house.	4568.09814453125
"my dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	4683.80078125
_you_
may ask questions, which _i_ shall not choose to answer."	4145.21142578125
but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.	4473.6552734375
do not distress me by the idea.	4538.67822265625
and with no one to speak to, of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and
vain and nonsensical as i knew i had!	4364.80419921875
on the very last day of the regiment's remaining in meryton, he dined
with others of the officers at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam's and mr. darcy's having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	5203.45654296875
but does not jane
correspond with the sister?	4748.34033203125
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word.	4217.0751953125
the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband, might then have rested in its proper place.	6237.95166015625
mr. bennet replied that he had not.	3189.00390625

this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.	5080.34033203125
every thing, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte's first sketch.	4608.60009765625
"both," replied elizabeth archly; "for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.--we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."	4679.3271484375
he promises fairly, and i hope among different people,
     where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be
     more prudent.	4816.44189453125
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	4436.90673828125
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"	4540.57421875
mr. darcy bowed.	6313.9873046875
good gracious!	5130.337890625
she saw with the creative eye of
fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	3882.040771484375
with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"good lord!	4441.373046875
elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	4196.38232421875
mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet: one
communication would, therefore, do for all.	4977.138671875
"i see your design, bingley," said his friend.--"you dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."	5137.9072265625
i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	4501.33544921875
can it be really so!	3589.462158203125
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you
will be satisfied with what i have done.	4054.044677734375
cried elizabeth.	4340.8271484375

"good gracious!	5722.9453125
when mrs. bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.	6102.4169921875
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have

"i am sure," said she, "i cried for two days together when colonel
millar's regiment went away.	4022.300048828125
the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them.	4397.154296875
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it.	4194.41357421875
"when you have killed all your own birds, mr. bingley," said her mother,
"i beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on mr.
bennet's manor.	5660.39892578125
poor little lizzy!	5321.4150390625
mr.
gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn
family; jane heard them with horror.	4223.087890625
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg:

1.e.1.	3125.0927734375
"i am afraid, mr. darcy," observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes."	4608.7802734375
"about a month," said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand."	4481.36669921875
till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_."	5263.71875
"oh!	4992.27490234375
no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy.	4457.52294921875
you must learn some
of my philosophy.	4028.165771484375
i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment
of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children,
produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable,
well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was
lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in
so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.	4549.75048828125
so much the man of fashion!	4968.15185546875
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.	4516.88916015625
"let me write for you," said jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."	4711.5634765625
as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	4758.92578125
mrs. bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.	4060.2158203125
mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	4912.99267578125
"you are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."	4995.0556640625
"there is a gentleman with him, mamma," said kitty; "who can it be?"	5321.27783203125
you will hardly blame me for refusing to
     comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	4623.62060546875
miss bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	4586.0078125
mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	4015.385986328125
i cannot
     understand it.	4871.9150390625
"but you see that jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."	4253.2236328125
she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run
such a risk.	4640.22119140625
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."	3997.36328125
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.	4086.772216796875
mr. bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.	4645.80029296875
with the kindest concern he
     came on to longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner
     most creditable to his heart.	4617.77734375
as the day of his arrival drew near,

"i begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said jane to her sister.	4754.6708984375
to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,

"i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.	4579.86279296875
"yes; to the last.	4988.5673828125
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton and see how every body went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.	5244.85791015625
the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	4299.40478515625
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	4931.2294921875
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	4749.07421875
lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	5361.55078125
if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	4139.27001953125
"i am
sorry it went off.	5256.4248046875
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	4117.90234375
accompanied by a violent yawn.	4474.23974609375
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.	5088.646484375
elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	5844.45849609375
mr.
bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say, but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before."	4751.19873046875
it is of no consequence.	4848.443359375
nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.	4124.4462890625
mr. collins
was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	5147.63330078125
1.e.7.	5430.17529296875
the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her.	4353.45068359375
not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley.	4507.353515625
mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	4723.1884765625
"she is a very fine-looking woman!	4086.6865234375
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during
their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested
them both.	4205.6328125
as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him!	4780.86962890625
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	4406.85595703125
it was consoling, that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	4334.89892578125
her answer was warmly in his favour.	5124.52880859375
elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.	5377.322265625
in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!	5371.427734375
_that_ abominable mr.	5161.412109375
you have a sweet room here, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.	5198.8583984375
a
little time therefore.--i shall certainly try to get the better."	4602.70556640625
he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present
arrangement.	5662.00244140625
i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am.	3353.64990234375
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	3645.675048828125
are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man?	5216.5390625
very odd!--and you only the
second.--the younger ones out before the elder are married!--your
younger sisters must be very young?"	4133.91650390625
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself."	5197.5244140625
but
these are not jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	4365.81591796875
mr. darcy had been at her
sister's wedding.	5409.97998046875
"i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.	4057.541259765625
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	4696.4677734375
"yes, she did."	4823.93017578125
"the person of whom i speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	4432.0263671875
i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had."	5175.869140625
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it
was rather too early to begin.	4830.1767578125
we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.	4964.40087890625
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place.	4489.8154296875
donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	4734.1875
"it is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--one does not know what to
think."	4396.5419921875
the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	5112.271484375
"the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."	5334.76318359375
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i
hope, though you have but a short lease."	5554.70849609375
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	4726.37890625
that he was _surprised_ by the
connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so
far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr. gardiner.	5353.8759765625
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to
have as little trouble in the business as possible.	4586.05126953125
i would go and see her, if i could have the
carriage."	4405.3896484375
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr. bingley in consequence of it, before _they_
did.	4878.65234375
when mr. bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure.	5670.88671875
my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think.	4555.21240234375
my father bears it better.	4477.40234375
i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit.	3685.16796875
mr. collins readily assented,
and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced
it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging
pardon, protested that he never read novels.--kitty stared at him, and
lydia exclaimed.--other books were produced, and after some deliberation
he chose fordyce's sermons.	3612.82568359375
wont it, kitty?"	5299.37451171875
i know we dine with four and twenty families."	4852.962890625
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.
wickham's attentions.	4247.3056640625
"this is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune!	5836.6328125
i understand that mr. collins has made
you an offer of marriage.	4784.19482421875
the tête-à-tête surprised
them.	4334.927734375
his former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them.	4371.54833984375
"i do, indeed," replied elizabeth, colouring.	5330.59814453125
you do not know what i suffer."	3808.53857421875
at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dove dale with
great perseverance.	4619.724609375
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	5231.12548828125
she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	3553.755859375
"you may well warn me against such an evil.	4052.703125
at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."	4881.10498046875
"what you ask," said elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and mr.
darcy had much better finish his letter."	4780.33203125
_my_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use
to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property.	4863.35986328125
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet's ill humour or ill
health.	5008.04443359375
i hope we
may often meet again."	4220.64794921875
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham, when
she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	4406.763671875
how well
it sounds.	4677.0517578125
those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."	4939.744140625
he then handed her
in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when
he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.	5711.72412109375
my
youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown
herself into the power of--of mr. wickham.	4509.34423828125
she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne's.	3996.978515625
as she pronounced these words, mr. darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued.	5191.525390625
i
shall now know how to act.	4198.45166015625
he then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister.	4629.3828125
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	4931.6904296875
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.	5375.1279296875
"i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas."	5340.138671875
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	4355.26953125
"he has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that
he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!	4436.49609375
he has
children of his own, and may have more.	4225.41259765625
i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."	4289.57177734375
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr. collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together."	4657.95166015625
colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to any body.	5636.26123046875
"take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	4740.4853515625
why jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing!	4281.32421875
the party did not supply much conversation.	6195.75
besides, there was truth in his
looks."	4854.16650390625
"you are quite right.	5032.50927734375
"but you forget, mama," said elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him."	4887.583984375
"i mention it, because it is the living which i ought to have had.	4898.27001953125
lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."	4798.3828125
he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	4662.65380859375
while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared
incomprehensible.	6200.58544921875
but of course she did not mention my name to you."	4490.64599609375
nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight.	5484.185546875
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of mr. darcy, she could not
but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits.	4202.48583984375
i knew you would be wishing me joy."	4991.2275390625
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,

"may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and
mrs. collins well."	4421.42138671875
_you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of any body.	4719.34375
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.	4954.458984375
"no, no, nonsense, lizzy.--i desire you will stay where you are."	4784.2041015625
have you heard from my uncle?"	4530.6259765625
"upon my word, sir," cried elizabeth, "your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.	4853.84716796875
_their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she
thought was still worse.	4277.21484375
and
yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and
ridicule."	4718.85302734375
miss bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane, received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.	4745.69189453125
"no, indeed.	5918.0341796875
as to what
restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	4727.5732421875
the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	5016.19384765625
it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."	3716.306884765625
it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	4587.45556640625
sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.--we have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine."	4171.37646484375
it was owing to him, to his
     reserve, and want of proper consideration, that wickham's character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was.	4199.39306640625
georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother.	4156.57275390625
i
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	4824.923828125
she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	1502.195556640625
he protested that except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.	4380.466796875
it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every
thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of
which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit.	5981.3955078125
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	7006.78515625
risk any thing rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."	4742.45263671875
you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it.	4592.97119140625
"to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!	4699.29052734375
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	4455.9931640625
at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and i
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	4223.728515625
hurst."	4538.591796875
i shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."	5580.34326171875
how i laughed!	4053.646484375
she had very little notice from any but him.	4550.95263671875
all that is known after this is, that they were seen
     to continue the london road.	5244.8125
after discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.	4366.140625
what a good joke it will be!	4781.1298828125
"whatever my connections may be," said elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."	4206.1064453125
"write to me very often, my dear."	4368.38525390625
wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,

"you, who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right.	4502.81689453125
"lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.	4469.57373046875
elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	3649.91552734375
in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.	5872.3154296875
but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	4323.1162109375
the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.	5815.36962890625
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs.
bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	4889.70556640625
she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	4714.11669921875
"i found," said he, "as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr. darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."	4874.42041015625
when mr.
collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte.	5069.9970703125
it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned.	5028.412109375
darcy_, you see, is the man!	5361.35107421875
he has not an ill-natured
look.	6485.21875
mr. darcy danced
only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	4689.056640625
"she
looks sickly and cross.--yes, she will do for him very well.	5057.3740234375
they agree with me in
     apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be
     injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady
     catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves
     with such a family.	4694.09912109375
as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	5127.0458984375
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,

"i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	4714.43115234375
but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good will which could not be
overlooked.	5118.11572265625
she had heard nothing of
lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she
thought she could witness without trepidation.	5008.77490234375
there
can be no occasion for your going so soon.	4895.2998046875
the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected.	4869.57861328125
mr. robinson's asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	4797.7099609375
"your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume," said miss
bingley;--"and pray what is the result?"	4441.3603515625
who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--how humiliating is this
discovery!--yet, how just a humiliation!--had i been in love, i could
not have been more wretchedly blind.	6564.869140625
"did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you
think better of me?	5559.1337890625
but at last your uncle was forced
     to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,
     was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
     which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your
     letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an
     explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give
     the praise where it was due.	4214.7958984375
of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself.	4698.73486328125
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr. darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia.	4811.001953125
sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	5182.46337890625
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine's
visit.	3559.491455078125
he should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	4638.919921875
she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	4609.052734375
1.c.	5207.6416015625
but you have chosen your fault well.--i
really cannot _laugh_ at it.	4550.8271484375
"my mother would have had no objection, but my father hates london."	4231.263671875
in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind."	4910.48681640625
he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james's, with very decent composure.	6168.55908203125
this cannot be!--engaged to mr. darcy!	4338.724609375
but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?--mr.	5864.7373046875
i owe all that i know
of it, to another, not to you."	5898.150390625
assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable.	4096.83203125
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above-mentioned; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their
carriage, miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on
elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	5002.95068359375
"but why all this secrecy?	5186.1318359375
then, after a short silence, he continued, "lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shews some greatness of mind."	5742.69287109375
i must speak to hill, this moment."	6682.63818359375
but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment.	4098.9423828125
jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.	5451.6884765625
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham.	4605.814453125
who would
have thought it!	4969.0146484375
bingley.--but--good
lord!	4575.134765625
here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	5604.20947265625
and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead.	5810.4638671875
"you must not blame my aunt.	5247.77978515625
elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	5604.5673828125
"and may i ask?"	4178.14111328125
but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."	5701.0087890625
darcy?--you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing."	4488.7666015625
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,

"lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe.	4891.375
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "how long did you
say that he was at rosings?"	3526.866943359375
but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.	4368.06884765625
it was really a very
handsome thought.	4672.94580078125
"and what is your success?"	4075.67578125
bingley was sure of
being liked wherever he appeared, darcy was continually giving offence.	6484.216796875
you have done all this!	4588.5146484375
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband.	5293.2880859375
it will not do.	5102.60302734375
elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	4776.0986328125
no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame.	4984.27294921875
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	5664.005859375
from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
collins's side, and as many bows on sir william's, they departed.	4945.037109375
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.	4520.138671875
but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."	5127.27099609375
"certainly not; at first.	6133.43896484375
mr. collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	4947.787109375
this was
very amiable, but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her
from any return of mr. collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.	4780.37744140625
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	4636.02783203125
it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland."	6364.52197265625
follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can.--but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without."	4875.8056640625
how thankful am i,
     that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must
     forget it ourselves.	3202.09912109375
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too
much.	3998.510986328125
"that is as it happens.	4810.47412109375
is there nothing you could take, to give you
present relief?--a glass of wine;--shall i get you one?--you are very
ill."

"no, i thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	4997.21923828125
i have met with two instances lately; one i will not mention;
the other is charlotte's marriage.	4611.958984375
colonel forster will, i dare say, do every
thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	4665.59814453125
mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia.	4740.6572265625
elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention!	4628.70751953125
it was very little less.	4255.69482421875
elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man.	3835.45263671875
she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.	5840.1240234375
"i have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as i generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage.	5165.67138671875
there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him
into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the
other had ever seen him.	4199.00048828125
a promise
of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept
without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some
ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great
self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	4634.31689453125
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.	4739.63134765625
"a great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	4898.732421875
"but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit."	4576.3916015625
"i am the less surprised at what has happened," replied sir william,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	5688.04541015625
his temptation is
not adequate to the risk."	5503.84423828125
they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either."	4424.3740234375
you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.	5267.314453125
how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton!	4710.732421875
i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."	4596.83203125
when lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short.	5252.6015625
"lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	5128.99267578125
and a
special licence.	4457.25537109375
she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.	4142.86767578125
nonsense, how can you talk so!	5231.6044921875
"my dear jane!"	4544.4990234375
collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him."	4631.87353515625
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken.	5378.9326171875
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could
offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never
appeared dissatisfied.	4303.99951171875
to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine, and her daughter; and on his return,
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.	3719.96630859375
she was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet.	4484.4833984375
as for your elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"	4052.66845703125
he had some intention, he added, of studying the law,
     and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
     be a very insufficient support therein.	5028.3310546875
but now several minutes elapsed,
without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable
to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she
as often found him looking at jane, as at herself, and frequently on no
object but the ground.	4737.8505859375
why is not every body as happy?"	4866.087890625
chapter v.


"i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter.	3608.51123046875
"they
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr. bingley and his sisters."	4641.10595703125
it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	5646.8173828125
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr. philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia's
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.	5162.11083984375
"he is certainly a good brother," said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.	5170.47705078125
here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	3512.98291015625
but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it."	4404.82666015625
"i never heard any thing so
abominable.	7342.73974609375
"unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do."	4564.20947265625
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:

     "my dearest lizzy,

     "i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	5606.91455078125
_he_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."	5390.1064453125
she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--it now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	5120.2978515625
at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here.	4294.05322265625
mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."	5128.943359375
in three volumes.	4667.35595703125
she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."	4551.2177734375
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought.	4985.380859375
now what have you to say?"	4519.431640625
"no," said her father, "wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	4689.40576171875
i am ashamed of you!	4973.19091796875
--it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.	4347.75390625
i cannot do justice to his kindness.	6148.25
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	4415.404296875
"i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."	4384.66748046875
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but sir william's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.	4137.7109375
you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."	4783.31884765625
but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr.	6135.978515625
she opened the
door, and met maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,

"oh, my dear eliza!	4592.349609375
"he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."	4737.412109375
"but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"	4847.7177734375
her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	5375.568359375
they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	3908.121337890625
she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class."	4236.37939453125
"my dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."	4608.92529296875
"well, and what news does it bring?	4387.82568359375
"this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	4670.41943359375
i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading!	3975.85595703125
and tell my dear
lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen
me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	4007.45556640625
i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point."	4859.85009765625
she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	4262.5673828125
i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say.	3696.900390625
he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."	4750.04345703125
"he
only told me, what i have now told you."	4468.943359375
your's, &c."

mr. darcy's letter to lady catherine, was in a different style; and
still different from either, was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins, in
reply to his last.	4453.5078125
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	4546.501953125
she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley's inattention.	4194.41357421875
"these are heavy misfortunes," replied elizabeth.	4955.71630859375
--and then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of
sight.	4657.51611328125
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for
mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle, lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when
mr. collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	4318.6494140625
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters.	4947.3486328125
chapter xiv.	5226.109375
she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,

"by the bye, charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."	4225.46484375
"nearly three weeks."	4827.46923828125
but i will no longer importune my young cousin."	6176.6708984375
"their conduct has been such," replied elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
i, nor any body, can ever forget.	4901.0595703125
"oh!	5643.3447265625
his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.	4691.861328125
had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	4890.55419921875
it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.	5566.529296875
she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter.	4456.79638671875
his letter was
soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was
quick in its execution.	3508.20556640625
"take whatever you like, and get away."	5387.51123046875
his regiment is there; for i suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars.	4870.68408203125
why does she not come in?"	3871.666259765625
"indeed, jane, you ought to believe me.--no one who has ever seen you
together, can doubt his affection.	5773.697265625
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	4346.66796875
said he; "that is rather singular."	5357.70703125
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post.	4192.73388671875
her liveliness had been never worse timed.	4976.78759765625
as yet, she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.	4987.72509765625
"i wish it may."	5262.654296875
they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	4100.44775390625
their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.	4558.07177734375
"nay," said elizabeth, "this is not fair.	7099.10791015625
"i honour your circumspection.	4586.16943359375
"i do not know when i have been more shocked," said she.	6155.7890625
one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.	4662.21337890625
from the farther disadvantage of lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though mrs. wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	4241.7236328125
i will try again.	5653.40185546875
you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	5846.47119140625
at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends, for
moments of such painful confusion.	4265.18212890625
he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	4022.415283203125
"oh, lord!	4043.88134765625
she will follow wherever lydia leads.	5149.07177734375
bingley was all grateful
pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her, after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.	5582.0146484375
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	5425.87890625
"i will not be interrupted.	4910.33203125
jane was by no means better.	4727.86669921875
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."	5270.921875
he
drew a chair near her.	4198.0234375
she longed to see mrs. philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "mrs. wickham," by
each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her
ring and boast of being married, to mrs. hill and the two housemaids.	5470.9384765625
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing,
she was still dear to him.	4997.271484375
we seem to have been designed for each
other."	5454.439453125
her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.	6564.2490234375
she is a great
reader and has no pleasure in anything else."	4411.0986328125
there was also a postscript to this
effect.	5065.744140625
"upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation."	5364.8134765625
the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas!	5277.92919921875
i will answer for it he never cared
three straws about her.	5609.04296875
he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.	4672.49560546875
she finds miss pope a treasure.	4865.470703125
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!	4978.36328125
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"	4855.43994140625
i only hope they may have half my
good luck.	5187.892578125
on
mr. and mrs. gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the
house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted
on each side with the utmost politeness.	4565.78125
"_her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	4549.62939453125
my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this.	4487.83349609375
my fingers wait your orders."	4608.912109375
it is every way horrible!"	6722.306640625
darcy!--there
is nothing like dancing after all.--i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies."	4297.0439453125
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself.	4554.81689453125
to caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit.	4618.0595703125
"with great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic."	5467.6728515625
can copy and distribute it in the united states without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.	4447.38330078125
"i am not going to run away, papa," said kitty, fretfully; "if _i_
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia."	4527.24365234375
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

"you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither.	4688.27880859375
it was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	4377.810546875
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.	3867.0869140625
why must their
marriage be private?	3734.401123046875
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.	4835.02978515625
how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you."	4595.556640625
mr. collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give.	4907.12548828125
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	4885.80419921875
did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"	4508.20068359375
"have you any idea, lizzy, who this gentleman is?	4289.064453125
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame.	5086.3369140625
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	6199.6689453125
but
at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	3928.16455078125
but it ought to
be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly."	4193.669921875
but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.--here you are in your own family."	4009.56201171875
"but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle.	4616.42578125
the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs. bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out.	4205.107421875
"mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself?"	5210.70166015625
but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr. darcy walk into the
room.	4098.8994140625
"lizzy," said he, "i was going to look for you; come into my room."	6311.4765625
they walked towards the lucases, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	4890.521484375
she
had ventured only one glance at darcy.	5204.25537109375
"if he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "i shall give him up for
ever."	4723.6298828125
his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do.	3597.63232421875
she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	4108.74267578125
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth's high
diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the
greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh
looked that way.	5195.185546875
"it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family,
it would be an unpleasant thing."	5162.8837890625
never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.	5439.40087890625
"yes, very well.	4426.55615234375
bingley?"	5088.1611328125
she was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham, a fortnight before they
took place.	4431.24462890625
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	3899.498779296875
not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
returned within the stated time.	4601.34521484375
"it ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."	3979.611572265625
my dear," continued mrs. bennet, "i am quite delighted with him.	4794.99755859375
she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.	5148.36962890625
it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment.	5236.146484375
how shall we punish him for such a speech?"	4819.515625
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.	4502.00537109375
"dear madam," cried mrs. hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner?	4272.224609375
they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.	6945.92919921875
you had much better
dance."	4646.251953125
but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how i am
ever to pay him."	5375.88134765625
her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of
the whole party.	3827.326416015625
the colour now rushed into elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued,

"you look conscious.	5213.0478515625
yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--she plays and sings all day long.	4893.9228515625
certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.	3556.90576171875
mr.
hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sophas and go to sleep.	5685.8544921875
elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.	5171.26611328125
anxiety on jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and mr.
darcy's explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost.	3378.631591796875
chapter vi.	4308.7021484375
her dirty petticoat
quite escaped my notice."	4171.400390625
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph.	5354.1826171875
they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy,
were to entertain each other.	4261.09619140625
the same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the
evening.	7164.33251953125
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	4637.77880859375
mrs. gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	4859.92431640625
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham's being among them.	7788.1279296875
she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.	4895.2861328125
"fitzwilliam darcy."	4103.95703125
"i leave it to yourself to determine," said mr. bennet.	4713.5859375
"but,"
she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	4964.3916015625
i hope you have destroyed the letter.	5324.53173828125
the note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.	4050.9140625
chapter iv.	4222.685546875
i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to
     your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

     william collins."	4492.7109375
mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.	5108.2412109375
chapter ix.	5177.533203125
i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers.	4807.75
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world.	4718.78076171875
about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	5713.80517578125
but, on second thoughts,
perhaps lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better
than any other person."	4306.74267578125
it is almost past belief.	4760.7734375
miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,

"pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?	5694.59130859375
"we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire."	4643.45703125
"how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it!	5235.1181640625
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.	4465.9482421875
what congratulations will
then flow in!	4845.02783203125
that such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts."	4771.88720703125
"certainly," replied elizabeth--"there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of _them_.	5549.541015625
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well, when she came into the room this morning.	4426.251953125
her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
"hunsford," and "lady catherine de bourgh."	5086.5166015625
but amidst
     your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
     displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
     consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to
     avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally
     bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to
     the sense and disposition of both.--i will only say farther, that
     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me
     before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
     connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following,
     as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon
     returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly
     resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly
     went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and
     enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have
     staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
     seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your
     sister's indifference.	4265.43017578125
when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	3693.140380859375
your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you.	5521.7666015625
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related.	4300.87744140625
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.	4972.81640625
mr. collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	3813.3251953125
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last on mrs. bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,

"oh!	4785.025390625
she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane with all possible mildness declined
interfering;--and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and
sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	4764.89306640625
"i hope, my dear," said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	4313.83349609375
"i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"	4545.2490234375
"i am not likely to leave kent for some time.	7108.3486328125
i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."	4917.89599609375
darcy!"	4558.44140625
let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest."	4995.298828125
despite these efforts, project gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.	4163.646484375
"indeed i do not dare."	5369.27685546875
and so extremely
accomplished for her age!	4799.1240234375
it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch-street by noon.	6532.2626953125
the day of his and lydia's departure soon came, and mrs. bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.	4655.10498046875
i grieve to
     find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed to depend upon their
     marriage; he shook his head when i expressed my hopes, and said he
     feared w. was not a man to be trusted.	5079.11474609375
good girl!	3903.353515625
as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."	5029.4912109375
said he hastily, as he opened the door.	4444.4404296875
her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world!	4629.515625
i know my dear uncle and
     aunt so well, that i am not afraid of requesting it, though i have
     still something more to ask of the former.	5115.63671875
"she is a most charming young lady indeed.	4487.76904296875
mr. collins to be sure was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary.	4465.30908203125
said she.	4594.876953125
lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won, and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and
mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.	4466.5654296875
have all her friends left her?"	4656.6767578125
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her
father was at leisure to be consulted.	5128.9189453125
you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery.	4621.5
unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.	5192.2041015625
it exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.	4438.2568359375
there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well.	4092.934814453125
much had been done, and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of
the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going
to be married.	4847.95361328125
even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with mr. wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on tuesday, could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday and
monday, endurable to kitty and lydia.	3738.97314453125
elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased.	3957.784423828125
"but if you have got them to-day," said elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."	5242.9326171875
of what he has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but
     of the truth of what i shall relate, i can summon more than one
     witness of undoubted veracity.	4194.41357421875
*       *       *       *       *




transcriber's note:

spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency
within the book.	5077.32763671875
"pray do, my dear miss lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."	4525.8408203125
"it did.	4825.6279296875
why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely
more."	4815.92724609375
he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."	4694.3994140625
while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	4438.52734375
he was very fond of them."	4530.03369140625
mr. darcy handed the ladies
into the carriage, and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him walking
slowly towards the house.	3847.083740234375
i appeal to mr. darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
sir.--you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."	4436.93603515625
"oh!	4213.01953125
but if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, i must be more explicit.	4881.74267578125
the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"	4497.53369140625
he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet, with a polite congratulation; mr. hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley's salutation.	4703.5546875
his affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame,
unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his
friend.	4826.125
chapter xvi.	4747.69287109375
"it certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said mr. bennet, "and
nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.	4878.6943359375
the moment of her release from
him was ecstacy.	4377.96533203125
very
nonsensical to come at all!	5081.638671875
having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	4252.44482421875
some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening.	5204.7763671875
but _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a
     loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible
     flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me
     actually married, you cannot greatly err.	5251.3642578125
i know not what to think.	4603.81640625
when mr. collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.	4860.5869140625
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.	4271.5810546875
mr. darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	5181.50927734375
"mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	4295.46630859375
she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy's
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.	4558.07177734375
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their
appearance before.	6634.2197265625
stop me whilst you can."	4502.662109375
"and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth!	4702.08349609375
the foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united
states.	4969.50244140625
but she had never felt so
strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly
used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters,
even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	5216.73779296875
my father was not
     only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always
     engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
     church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	4813.705078125
i saw them the night before last."	4865.64697265625
by this time she is
actually with them!	3930.6865234375
i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.--these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."	4253.1181640625
"oh, lord!	4325.537109375
i can hardly write for
     laughing.	4936.400390625
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name, throughout the whole of this business, i will
     immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement.	4624.30419921875
darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.	5018.72998046875
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.	4747.0
she directly replied,

"you need not be frightened.	4684.4931640625
if mr. darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice?	4121.4541015625
elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile.	5305.30078125
i cannot think of it without abhorrence."	4194.11767578125
--cried elizabeth.	4363.60546875
may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"	4282.1572265625
they found mr. bennet still up.	6091.5205078125
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether _all_ her sisters were at longbourn.	5272.6015625
oh!	4498.03564453125
it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.	5108.00732421875
once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear.	5717.1083984375
elizabeth immediately recognising the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected.	6973.50048828125
it is a great comfort to have you
     so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
     think of us.	4695.1376953125
poor
jane!	4416.7138671875
when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to
his sister.	4622.90185546875
"if i," said mr. collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--i do not mean however to
assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	4603.25
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	4599.4365234375
"and have you heard from him often?"	4748.0595703125
but that is one great difference between
us.	4585.0498046875
"though it is difficult," said jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."	4489.11767578125
it seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	4951.2568359375
it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.	5705.92041015625
who should suffer but myself?	6107.0048828125
it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.	4790.203125
let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to mr.
darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has
treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner.	5225.45654296875
his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide,
there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her
to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced,
that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the
amiable and pleasing.	5701.50341796875
elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.	4776.59521484375
mr. wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return.	4409.3408203125
our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia's character.	4601.8671875
cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	5083.72802734375
pray make my excuses to pratt, for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	5369.52783203125
the least agreeable
circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to
elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person.	4537.41455078125
"i know them a little.	4530.9111328125
i thought i should have died.	3875.744873046875
she is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all.	3802.724365234375
not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
i know are all chance in this world.	4193.57763671875
you _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	4727.6953125
from his garden, mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows,
but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's
help.	4751.46142578125
she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	6000.330078125
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "project gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.e.1
through 1.e.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
project gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.e.8 or
1.e.9.	3917.700439453125
vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonimously.	5533.47509765625
"and what arts did he use to separate them?"	4201.0751953125
"i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!"	4481.54638671875
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks
of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	4873.20703125
said elizabeth.	4386.478515625
"i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried elizabeth.	4624.0615234375
jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
evening.--elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
else gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for
happiness.	5006.73583984375
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.	3809.515869140625
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--"i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.	5089.7333984375
we know
how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	4518.21630859375
"this will not do," said elizabeth.	4093.879638671875
how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love?	4520.57373046875
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases, and again during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.	5032.7685546875
i was only confused for the moment, because i felt
that i _should_ be looked at.	4907.21435546875
oh!	4204.939453125
jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	4808.19921875
they met again on sunday, and
     then _i_ saw him too.	5229.13037109375
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.	4637.482421875
she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
darcy did not wish for cards; and mr. hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.	4773.3798828125
i will not encourage
the impudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn."	4581.4091796875
and is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	4414.89501953125
she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy's farther notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	4860.54052734375
but it is all, all too late now."	4160.34814453125
but enough of this.	4980.74267578125
"my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.--when they get to our age i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.	5429.8232421875
chapter i.


elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	4976.59765625
my sole dependence was on you; and
i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	4765.7158203125
limited warranty, disclaimer of damages - except for the "right
of replacement or refund" described in paragraph 1.f.3, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation, the owner of the project
gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a project
gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.	4231.25537109375
it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened.	4606.0341796875
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn-house.	3711.546630859375
of
this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.	4966.95361328125
he could tell her nothing new of the
wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
out like his information.	4534.8232421875
the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	5827.900390625
"if he wants our society, let
him seek it.	4950.0859375
jane was not happy.	3846.001708984375
mr. wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	4910.767578125
elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	4663.1826171875
mr. collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs. bennet.	4507.33642578125
the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine.	3893.820556640625
"i am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said lady
catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal."	5037.91650390625
cried his wife impatiently.	4577.19921875
he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it."	4414.322265625
"aye, there she comes," continued mrs. bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided
she can have her own way.--but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take
it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead.--_i_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you.--i have done with you from this very day.--i
told you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you
again, and you will find me as good as my word.	4244.28125
elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	4519.28515625
how could he spare half ten
thousand pounds?"	5166.380859375
repeated darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."	4016.680419921875
it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it.	5422.7490234375
on the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	4230.1943359375
mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made
no answer.	4103.63623046875
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria's astonishment, at her
being so thin, and so small.	6611.236328125
yours ever,

     "caroline bingley."	5009.591796875
cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls.	4526.078125
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	4194.41357421875
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.	4750.4873046875
there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected.	4493.71337890625
"_you_ were mr. bingley's first choice."	4953.75048828125
"you shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.	4270.9619140625
cried lydia.	4972.01513671875
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him!	4071.041259765625
it distressed her a little, and she was
quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the
parsonage.	4133.99560546875
"yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."	5155.390625
"how despicably have i acted!"	4171.189453125
chapter x.


more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
meet mr.	4197.0625
"i have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.	4442.65673828125
"oh!	4379.79833984375
he readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting, look, went away.	5187.185546875
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet's height, or
rather taller."	3949.338623046875
lady catherine seemed pleased.	5011.61328125
after sitting long enough to admire every
article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to
give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london,
mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large
and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	5178.73828125
"let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."	4677.46240234375
my dear," said maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not lady
catherine.	4702.03857421875
at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here."	5980.7685546875
contact the
foundation as set forth in section 3 below.	4610.6884765625
the
other is miss de bourgh.	7788.1279296875
elizabeth was delighted.	6747.63916015625
"wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as jane's."	4793.67138671875
mr. bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house.	4388.068359375
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness.	4396.09765625
there was too much to
be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	6311.4765625
yet he knew to the contrary himself.	4142.986328125
our situation
with regard to lady catherine's family is indeed the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	3972.820068359375
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.	4499.5283203125
"oh!"	4696.59326171875
"and what is fifty miles of good road?	4049.88671875
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine.	5602.2431640625
chapter ix.	4266.2314453125
here comes hill.	5175.203125
"how strange this is!	6153.85791015625
i have not forgot, you see; and i assure
you, i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."	4063.028076171875
this will never do."	4445.85205078125
bingley?"	5102.8271484375
"yes, sir, i know i am.	5634.203125
what is to become of us!	4815.7939453125
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of every one.	4293.11962890625
"when i consider," she added, in a yet
more agitated voice, "that _i_ might have prevented it!--_i_ who knew
what he was.	4598.0947265625
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich,
     he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation
     must have been benefited by marriage.	5031.41064453125
but
     last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	4886.05078125
besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."	5358.75927734375
absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr. collins.	4276.97412109375
"good god!	6703.408203125
"indeed, mr. bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"	5119.15087890625
"yours, &c."

"well, my dear," said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr. bingley, and under your orders."	4606.060546875
jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to
join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	4725.96875
what hours of transport we shall spend!	4247.62158203125
said mr. gardiner.	5038.56982421875
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married.	4798.32763671875
from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting.--her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.	4425.0830078125
"my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."	5213.828125
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.	4868.59423828125
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
unwillingly said so.	4624.07470703125
till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr. darcy and his relation, colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself.	4696.22607421875
i told mrs. collins so before you came.	3742.1123046875
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?	5093.39013671875
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation,

"i am not."	4548.86572265625
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	4243.9169921875
if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"	4318.443359375
perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_
     reserve, can be answerable for the event.	5643.3828125
cried miss bingley, "charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.	3505.6904296875
he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the
trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,
persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	4490.6806640625
no
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	5608.7646484375
darcy said
nothing at all.	4861.45849609375
had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what
ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she
thought he must be sensible himself.	5106.16162109375
cried bingley.	4497.94970703125
_that_ is all settled."	4068.479736328125
i am not romantic you know.	4391.2080078125
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,

"did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?"	4428.3759765625
"if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it."	4355.5107421875
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends.	5761.958984375
but i knew i should
persuade you at last.	4520.70751953125
her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	6319.37841796875
i quite detest the man."	4771.3955078125
i am sick of them all.	5693.4619140625
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock.	4384.99755859375
"and what am i to do on the occasion?--it seems an hopeless business."	4240.24365234375
she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.	4690.73828125
and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	4398.25341796875
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth.	4355.58935546875
steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	5637.25048828125
what relates to yourself, is as follows.	4933.5390625
elizabeth immediately began playing again.	4938.84912109375
you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do, when i
tell you all."	7074.095703125
has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves?	5422.9970703125
every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any
thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.	3976.31103515625
to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	4119.35546875
she is a handsome girl, about
fifteen or sixteen, and i understand highly accomplished.	5518.48193359375
the
possibility of meeting mr. darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred.	4748.91552734375
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and
mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	5756.70263671875
their other engagements were few; as the style of living of
the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the collinses' reach.	6192.9677734375
in anticipating the happiness of bingley,
which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the
conversation till they reached the house.	4743.2666015625
mrs. bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	4516.5146484375
as they drove to mr. gardiner's
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.	1375.7852783203125
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	4386.45751953125
all field sports were over.	4862.04736328125
[illustration: dove-dale]




pride & prejudice.	4728.791015625
_she_ will not be able to help calling."	4647.22705078125
"and this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection!	4809.41455078125
i shall see her in january.	4694.56494140625
chapter xvii.	4482.0546875
but think no more of the letter.	4091.51025390625
have not you always hated him?"	5387.4033203125
she supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what
might arise in that quarter.	4294.86865234375
for, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	6415.2900390625
darcy."	6138.92236328125
but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger
impulses even than pride."	5336.56982421875
"did you go by the village of kympton?"	3944.400146484375
every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers' names and connections.	4766.14306640625
the discussion of mr. collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	4789.490234375
let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance.	4321.46337890625
"what does mr. darcy mean," said she to charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?"	4482.89697265625
they
had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if
not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small
market-town, where the family did not visit.	4327.85595703125
well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him.	4052.641357421875
"with my mother up stairs.	4464.84912109375
and when
the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five
altogether; mr. bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.	4197.05859375
"obstinate, headstrong girl!	4739.49560546875
lord!	4202.4375
lord bless me!	4377.31396484375
that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her
family!	5017.9501953125
her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,

"i can guess the subject of your reverie."	4169.869140625
i was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."	4343.6923828125
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.	4674.37646484375
his marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that
she "_wished_ they might be happy."	3974.946044921875
"no more have i," said mr. bennet; "and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."	3693.478515625
"if you were aware," said elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."	4790.6279296875
yes.--do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be
placed in the gallery at pemberley.	6007.2978515625
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but
mrs. bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,

"you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	5086.6474609375
it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high.	4487.32861328125
though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	4726.072265625
i am not so
     selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	4948.61328125
she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged.	5412.3125
after a slight preparation
for good news, the letter was read aloud.	4546.4716796875
young ladies of her age, are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."	5052.03271484375
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy's, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning.	4774.80517578125
there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.	5599.33740234375
we had better go into the
avenue."	4840.8203125
she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprung.	4861.560546875
he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid, she had no knowledge of it.	5715.576171875
you see how continually we are engaged there.	5170.4423828125
but though
every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend
that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	4342.8974609375
jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	4766.4609375
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth, from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge.	4168.6484375
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."	4754.18994140625
how odious i should think them!"	3570.336669921875
"he brought it with him for us to see."	4236.6259765625
he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments.	4530.71630859375
"perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	4012.078857421875
"and is this all?"	3862.472412109375
and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that
would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	4321.2158203125
"what could become of mr. bingley and jane!"	4131.50048828125
we want none of them;
do we?"	4660.501953125
his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	5722.388671875
he has heartily forgiven me
now."	4236.93701171875
"at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."	4354.4970703125
the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.	4498.052734375
"nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.	4510.677734375
"never, sir."	5200.583984375
but mrs.
bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	5681.361328125
as she went up stairs to get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
saying,

"i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself.	4049.813232421875
at length the parsonage was discernible.	4846.80224609375
cried he.	5830.84130859375
her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	6216.21044921875
"the conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, i hope, improved
in civility."	4985.162109375
her own thoughts were employing her.	4740.48095703125
"i beg your pardon.	4891.841796875
they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	4581.9638671875
if i was to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better.	4062.473876953125
but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's.	4334.33642578125
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley, and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane.	5535.83984375
mr. collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.	4716.7744140625
the officers will find
women better worth their notice.	6301.06005859375
they are descended on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	4285.744140625
colonel forster gives us reason
     to expect him here soon.	4113.29052734375
three daughters married!	4677.88623046875
can i speak plainer?	3854.2705078125
but he found, in reply to
     this question, that wickham still cherished the hope of more
     effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	3694.58837890625
but the case is
this.	5291.89501953125
had it been your uncle's doing, i must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way.	4075.038330078125
mr. darcy was
     punctual in his return, and as lydia informed you, attended the
     wedding.	4548.68798828125
mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.	6125.16796875
mrs. bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.	4308.0078125
"has your governess left you?"	5023.74365234375
"yes, in conjunction with his friend."	3894.6005859375
"did charlotte dine with you?"	4475.34912109375
her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.	4505.17919921875
no, no, this is not likely.	4671.55078125
"how can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!	4468.943359375
during their walk, it was resolved that mr. bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening.	5372.125
"dining out," said mrs. bennet, "that is very unlucky."	4870.04296875
her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.	4971.25146484375
"yes, madam," said mrs. bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.	4621.95849609375
but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say, very agreeable.	4206.12646484375
could there be
finer symptoms?	4685.88720703125
ten
thousand a year, and very likely more!	5620.876953125
no principle of either,
would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy.	4405.45703125
she seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	4010.663330078125
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the
     address specified in section 4, "information about donations to
     the project gutenberg literary archive foundation."	4955.18212890625
a young man, such
as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	5680.39111328125
it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr. collins joining
in, observed,

"yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her.	5086.541015625
and so
she asked the two harringtons to come, but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	4567.44482421875
she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn, had by some accident been
lost.	4698.07177734375
"you either chuse this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, i should be
completely in your way;--and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire."	4363.126953125
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what i look
on as a point of duty.	4115.185546875
it is unaccountable!	7960.95751953125
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence.	3733.550048828125
this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her,
immediately followed.	4896.5419921875
"but does lydia know nothing of this?	4612.619140625
and when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "i shall insist on their giving one also.	4545.11474609375
it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in."	4723.56689453125
it is of all subjects my delight.	4441.54248046875
they had long wished to see him.	4995.537109375
by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	4565.5634765625
a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	4533.720703125
she was received, however, very politely by them;
and in their brother's manners there was something better than
politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--mr.	4333.85302734375
she looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	4403.51611328125
he enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever
done.	4784.6875
chapter xi.	4744.34326171875
cried elizabeth, "i am excessively diverted.	4962.833984375
you will find her manners beyond any
thing i can describe; and your wit and vivacity i think must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.	4206.83251953125
i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better."	6098.6123046875
we passed each other
several times.	4120.337890625
"but he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune."	4267.57861328125
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.	4436.5595703125
but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable.	4297.61767578125
when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth's
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	4611.61181640625
he was silent.	4549.958984375
elizabeth did all she could, to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him
to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to
either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley.	5085.81787109375
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manoeuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	4697.04150390625
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual.	4549.65087890625
"your's sincerely, &c."

miss bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	4356.39111328125
"that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask.	4433.71728515625
"what an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was
shut.	3689.306884765625
"a man who has once been refused!	3782.30029296875
it was possible, however,
that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more
information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the
application was a something to look forward to.	4509.3486328125
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and
affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	5572.87109375
if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."	4293.35302734375
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and with
an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,

"so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george
wickham!--your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you,
among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the
late mr. darcy's steward.	5402.3701171875
"i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.--we may compare our different opinions."	4968.56884765625
i am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.	5018.39501953125
what has she to do with it?	4910.96923828125
and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr. collins thus
addressed her,

"when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."	5506.5009765625
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	4252.96435546875
the possibility of mr. collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from
possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the
bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,

"engaged to mr. collins!	4164.71044921875
but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "is it in
address that he improves?	4884.23876953125
"for the liveliness of your mind, i did."	5288.171875
so, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."	3479.61328125
darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you."	4427.6201171875
it is really too distressing.	4497.98388671875
mr. collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many
servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	4689.78125
no one made any reply.	4600.00244140625
mr. gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk.	3989.947998046875
limited right of replacement or refund - if you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.	4872.44482421875
what will become of me.	5170.60009765625
"sometimes.	5005.3369140625
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them.	4954.345703125
were it known to the rest
of my family, i should not have merely my own gratitude to express."	4472.78466796875
but, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if i still assert, that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	4804.857421875
how unlucky!	3969.7333984375
"it is from miss bingley," said jane, and then read it aloud.	5189.02587890625
she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued however
impenetrably grave.	4303.00244140625
"you judge very properly," said mr. bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	4348.6455078125
if they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	4490.2607421875
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	4699.7119140625
but that
gentleman," looking at darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."	4659.630859375
elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	4609.298828125
mrs. bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	3837.8017578125
scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.	4878.40087890625
the business was therefore soon settled.	5068.57080078125
i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	3508.955078125
they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	4760.2919921875
this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself."	4382.19677734375
added elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."	4166.943359375
let me advise you then, my dear sir,
     to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy
     child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the
     fruits of her own heinous offence.	5349.74169921875
lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room.	4769.55322265625
the feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation."	5329.515625
his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in
his pleasure.	4524.90869140625
he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	4917.60986328125
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
mr. collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure."	5084.72216796875
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy.	4322.7490234375
she
could think of nothing else, and yet whether bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he
had been aware of jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.	5251.1240234375
her father lifted up his eyes.	4630.87548828125
"yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	4365.416015625
"shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"	4451.25732421875
"my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	6235.53662109375
it would be such a delicious scheme,
and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	4348.78271484375
i am so
grieved for him.	4127.6611328125
her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr. bingley's name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.	4429.2080078125
put them next to your great uncle
the judge.	6788.04296875
why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?	4405.68798828125
miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	6424.4365234375
"kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"i do not cough for my own amusement," replied kitty fretfully.	4993.26513671875
we have not met since the 26th of november, when
we were all dancing together at netherfield."	4274.09912109375
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"	4083.336181640625
had i known what
i ought, what i dared, to do!	3696.900390625
the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	4359.31298828125
what are we to do!"	4353.30126953125
why any fear of detection?	4271.181640625
and having to relate such a thing of
his sister!	4630.5087890625
it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be.	4244.3095703125
not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	4286.705078125
i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly.	5154.36328125
when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	5706.8671875
darcy?"	5378.12744140625
"if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.	4458.47119140625
you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater, when i write to them, and sign my name lydia

he scarcely ever spoke to
her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.	4663.86328125
chapter xiv.	4327.16650390625
you know i always
speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling
post by themselves.	4540.29736328125
"so, lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love i find.	4566.1904296875
but perhaps mr. bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle."	4043.66552734375
he would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,
through her mother's hands, lydia's expences had been very little within
that sum.	4341.990234375
it was my brother gardiner's drawing up too, and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it.	4493.76513671875
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience
was severe.	4313.49169921875
all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.	4701.55859375
and her calling here was prodigiously
civil!	5036.701171875
i
am sure my sisters must all envy me.	4209.4130859375
this was agreed to, and mrs. philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	4621.63232421875
again she read on.	4842.939453125
charlotte did not stay much
longer, and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	4875.35009765625
on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided.	4075.597900390625
"i certainly shall not.	4305.1123046875
that is the place to get
husbands.	5203.04931640625
if this be the case, he deserves you.	4194.41357421875
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	5795.3056640625
but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "mrs.
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	5163.6962890625
she turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.	4444.00390625
that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice!	4402.748046875
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.	4998.9443359375
i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.	5052.66845703125
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.	5100.0390625
such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,
are not worth a regret.	5055.37744140625
our distress, my
     dear lizzy, is very great.	3946.048095703125
the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	5903.7099609375
"gracechurch-street, monday,

     august 2.	4954.29833984375
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.	3952.17578125
"oh!	4762.53076171875
do not repeat what i then said.	4892.35009765625
"i have not a doubt of mr. bingley's sincerity," said elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	3936.5498046875
he paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,

"my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing?--mr.	4539.48779296875
"that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well.	5397.6630859375
mrs. bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last.'	5846.79443359375
"do let us have a little music,"--cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.--"louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr.	4668.52685546875
she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	3875.744873046875
"you never will be able to make both
of them good for any thing.	4435.6416015625
in this manner lady catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,

"i take no leave of you, miss bennet.	4630.95068359375
let me never see either
one or the other again!"	4574.8076171875
i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	5090.646484375
after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to elizabeth,

"i hope you are well, miss bennet.	4354.20654296875
"it was a subject which they could not mention before me."	6033.5595703125
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	3932.07373046875
mr. collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	5129.7802734375
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.	4949.2314453125
no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	4565.515625
"i see no occasion for that.	4716.783203125
"yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside."	4920.9970703125
said elizabeth.	5123.1845703125
my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"	4390.73046875
i am not at all afraid of her dying.	3935.2099609375
but to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good
of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of
the bad--belongs to you alone.	4073.9736328125
"how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."	6053.0166015625
when those dances
were over she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.	4809.1669921875
her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object.	5170.47705078125
it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley's pretended regard."	4609.4833984375
"he is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?"	4492.1240234375
i believe him to be lady catherine's _nephew_.	5800.76318359375
bingley was by no means deficient,
but darcy was clever.	4465.9736328125
it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.	4265.91845703125
had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr. darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	4034.9326171875
_my_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."	5062.8896484375
when they
had gained their own room, jane taking out the letter, said,

"this is from caroline bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a
good deal.	4198.73193359375
"is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?"	4741.8828125
she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."	4131.49658203125
"good heavens!"	5574.59326171875
you wanted me, i know, to say 'yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.	6077.93603515625
in three volumes.	4166.240234375
"shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"	5431.69287109375
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford, they reached mr. gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.	4147.86474609375
jane was distressed.	5164.32177734375
"an excellent consolation in its way," said elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_.	4136.3974609375
i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun."	4859.31689453125
when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chuses."	5380.72314453125
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected.	4429.61767578125
"sir, you quite misunderstand me," said mrs. bennet, alarmed.	4937.525390625
"two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
     magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	4959.31884765625
jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw mr. darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.	5433.1279296875
"what do you mean?"	4638.0263671875
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.	6014.2802734375
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention.	4128.73974609375
"of whom does jane ever think ill?	4956.4580078125
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent, had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.	4232.2041015625
mr. collins made his
declaration in form.	4574.63330078125
i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_i_ have seen nothing of it."	4853.41650390625
and
     will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
     to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin a list,
     according to his information.	4150.89599609375
"you have insulted me, in every possible method.	4817.0478515625
what made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here?	4300.6884765625
but
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	4245.896484375
"would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"	3886.341552734375
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.	4997.10009765625
lady catherine it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
darcy.	4731.66455078125
is not this an agreeable surprise?"	5312.6376953125
i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	5014.037109375
"dear sir,

     "i must trouble you once more for congratulations.	4836.79638671875
"i hope not so.	5773.791015625
that tall, proud man."	4419.40625
no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called.	5226.62255859375
miss bennet still looked all amazement.	5027.50146484375
his doing so
drew her notice.	5737.13134765625
i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."	4370.33544921875
however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."	4804.724609375
"something very much to the purpose of course.	5269.8212890625
a
most delightful place!--excellent parsonage house!	4117.583984375
but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	4898.07373046875
her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself.	4681.1572265625
"not as you represent it.	5099.5869140625
chapter xix.	4308.55419921875
"yet why did he come?"	4658.9423828125
she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject.	4281.33642578125
"i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at
pemberley.	5400.6240234375
mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to any body, went away.	4655.59326171875
then shewing
her purchases: "look here, i have bought this bonnet.	5230.01806640625
and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree
     of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of
     yourself and mrs. bennet, i am inclined to think that her own
     disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of
     such an enormity, at so early an age.	4292.70654296875
these recollections will not do at
all.	4366.82763671875
"no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton."	3892.424560546875
"i am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with.	5532.41455078125
kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, mrs. forster and me are _such_ friends!)	4152.00830078125
such i was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth!	4299.01953125
the wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.	4214.638671875
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.	4607.365234375
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	5838.94873046875
"perhaps," said darcy, "i should have judged better, had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	4089.836669921875
there
could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom mr. darcy could have
such boundless influence.	4666.8623046875
"we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
jane: "i hope and trust they will yet be happy.	4733.4609375
they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	4537.04248046875
this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for.	4206.892578125
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"oh, papa, what news?	5647.3017578125
maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	4353.66650390625
oh!	5062.3583984375
but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	4690.935546875
i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done."	5212.26708984375
"he is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	4967.68310546875
it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.	4819.529296875
it was
unpardonable.	5256.419921875
she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before.	4417.93994140625
it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."	6289.55126953125
mr. bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!	4797.04638671875
he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.	4401.55126953125
as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	5136.599609375
this
unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure
of seeing you at pemberley to-day."	5451.37646484375
"it _is_ wonderful,"--replied wickham,--"for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend.	5375.3740234375
"that is not an unnatural surmise," said fitzwilliam, "but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	4642.31005859375
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has created, a
     suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his
     real character.	4819.189453125
what news?	4873.31396484375
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	4563.00830078125
at first there
seemed danger of lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in
particular.	5146.18017578125
and it was not wholly without foundation.	4507.2333984375
i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of
his constancy.	4156.818359375
but you are always giving _her_ the
preference."	4289.9072265625
he has given in all his debts; i hope
     at least he has not deceived us.	3882.859130859375
be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business.	6069.4443359375
"i am sure there is not on _his_.	5114.8076171875
i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	4886.08837890625
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg-tm
license terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with project gutenberg-tm.	5305.33154296875
but i know the
foundation is unjust.	4042.416259765625
"this young
gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage.	4837.15625
i rather wished, than
     believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to
     accede to his proposal.	4792.35498046875
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	4412.1044921875
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr. bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his
friend to join it.	4227.3232421875
happy shall i be, when his stay at netherfield is over!"	4590.0771484375
my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me."	4759.13916015625
said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.	4604.34765625
"i dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."	4673.76123046875
after tea, mr. bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went up stairs to her instrument.	7547.375
are the others coming out?"	4822.6787109375
"in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.	4194.681640625
he must go
     somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
     nothing to live on.	4916.26904296875
it is a pity they are not handsome!	4819.89697265625
lydia laughed, and said,

"aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	5418.3447265625
your tempers are by no means unlike.	4458.93896484375
mr. bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	4300.4794921875
"mr.	4196.70654296875
"i do not think we were speaking at all.	4544.31298828125

_her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.	4151.77099609375
"i must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
jane, "and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.	4608.52978515625
when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were.	4527.26953125
"money!	4607.189453125
but little had she dared
to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	5398.21923828125
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all miss bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	4743.8095703125
and now do, when you get to town, find them out,

--my mind however is now made up on
     the subject, for having received ordination at easter, i have been
     so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right
     honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh,
     whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable
     rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
     demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be
     ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are
     instituted by the church of england.	4820.9638671875
he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.	5786.52490234375
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.	4425.3994140625
i should be sorry to think so
ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."	4432.65185546875
i do not know any body who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr.	4746.4296875
what could be the meaning of it?--it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.	4129.52734375
"what sort of a girl is miss darcy?"	4708.962890625
"it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, mr. bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me.	3998.2861328125
if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity
unblemished could make him.	4230.24267578125
i will
think no more about him."	4959.49365234375

"good gracious!"	4322.2958984375
had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort.	5135.1396484375
but if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."	4454.73095703125
and i think you will agree with me,
     in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both
     on his account and my niece's.	5342.669921875
i must find mr. gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be
delayed; i have not an instant to lose."	4255.75146484375
but let me advise you to think better of it.	5410.8212890625
she could not think of darcy's leaving kent, without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.	5254.064453125
mrs. bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to elizabeth,

"miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn.	4262.546875
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one."	4345.47412109375
oh, that i knew how it was!"	4602.30615234375
she wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	5375.55859375
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	4692.03125
ten thousand a year!	4796.1728515625
her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	5340.74951171875
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	4847.8330078125

this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.	4217.6787109375
yes," said elizabeth drily--"mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	4280.15673828125
an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure.	4486.83642578125
we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."	4108.80517578125
this is my advice.	4298.27734375
it would have been strange if they had.	4134.72119140625

were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,

but i must tell you how it went off.	4433.89892578125
however, i
recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for mr. darcy might have done as well."	4923.56494140625
i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."	5058.42041015625
but i was not then
     master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	4732.255859375
mr. gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	4475.32763671875
it must be my uncle's doings!	4912.49609375
but it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for
her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a
sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham.	4557.19384765625
whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."	5580.880859375
"i did not know before," continued bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character.	4919.42529296875
how can mr. bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?	3970.79736328125
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other, the balm of sisterly consolation."	4665.42041015625
said mrs. bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	4648.2509765625
i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	4399.935546875
no, kitty, i have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it.	4210.59326171875
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."	5838.3251953125
who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"	5116.62744140625
when they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be
soon married to mr.	3330.71044921875
good heaven!	2912.2373046875
they will then join his regiment,
     unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from
     mrs. gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,
     before she leaves the south.	5192.7880859375
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing
colour.	5134.4150390625
mr.
     darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	4126.1533203125
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	4697.5966796875
repeated mr. bennet.	4121.39892578125
it was
the last of the regiment's stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	4836.79638671875
"but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day."	4436.6611328125
when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion
of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the change was so
great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible.	5494.86572265625
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	4518.77197265625
i wonder what he can be doing there."	4994.33203125
"but consider your daughters.	4197.11865234375
i knew how it
would be.	5041.45361328125
it has been my own doing,
and i ought to feel it."	3940.35107421875
good bye."	4858.68212890625
_they_ will never be distressed
for money.	4911.484375
she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.	4219.7021484375
however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."	4840.64453125
"if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think."	4953.92529296875
i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	4623.03857421875
chapter xix.	4295.16748046875
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr. collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.	4587.75732421875
nobody can tell what i
suffer!--but it is always so.	4311.07763671875
mr. darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."	5362.53759765625
he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	4841.09716796875
"nothing child, nothing.	3647.810302734375
if you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.	4295.29052734375
five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs.
bennet, for many years after lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would.	4632.31982421875
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects
which occupied them; lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table,
after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet was
doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	4467.421875
and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	4419.537109375
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together.	5022.83349609375
though darcy could never receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for
elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	4129.95263671875
i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior.	4938.919921875
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character.	4826.447265625
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	3942.94091796875
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.	4685.41357421875
"he could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me?	5218.4794921875
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	4301.86572265625
i speak
feelingly.	4411.5361328125
said he,
with a look of doubt.	3890.88427734375
the
quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas
of happiness!	4848.71630859375
"i can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."	5030.90673828125
i _must_ have employment and society.	4474.6875
"his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
elizabeth angrily; "for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr. darcy's steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself."	5197.638671875
the very mention of any
thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	5752.52099609375
but elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished
her all imaginable happiness.	4157.5400390625
and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them?	5587.69775390625
her mother
would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	4064.690673828125
they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her.	3909.549072265625
"my dear mr. bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome!	4445.27587890625
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs.
gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	4730.90185546875
"one of them does."	5261.8212890625
"if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it."	5381.04150390625
"my dear father, i congratulate you."	4832.9140625
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia's leaving
home.	4196.658203125
five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!--i never heard of such a thing.	4194.41357421875
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	4710.3818359375
with astonishment did elizabeth see, that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	5246.1884765625
"a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.	4363.0517578125
oh, lydia!"	5299.9560546875
jane was beyond competition her
favourite child.	5249.041015625
miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful.	3772.58447265625
"that it ought not to be attempted.	4432.27587890625
1813.	4533.75048828125
jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she
knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham.--the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be
otherwise explained.	4556.3681640625
she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	5713.16796875
"yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded."	4771.74169921875

pride and prejudice:

a novel.	4618.5439453125
i need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable.	4363.52197265625
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an
agitated manner, and thus began,

"in vain have i struggled.	4735.50634765625
"oh!	4655.52685546875
"if i had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her.	4525.4482421875
the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	5022.3212890625
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr. wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.	4934.828125
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern.	4355.55224609375
it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."	4416.08642578125
but the
clothes, the wedding clothes!	5032.17822265625
"well, lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they?	5540.28662109375
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	4194.41357421875
in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs. collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to mrs. collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.	4624.46728515625
wickham only shook his head.	4126.96435546875
wickham.--wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of
     my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who
     had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
     had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,
     to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could
     be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--but
     from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally
     bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope to be in
     future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
     motives has been read.--if, in the explanation of them which is
     due to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
     may be offensive to your's, i can only say that i am sorry.--the
     necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--i
     had not been long in hertfordshire, before i saw, in common with
     others, that bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other
     young woman in the country.--but it was not till the evening of the
     dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a
     serious attachment.--i had often seen him in love before.--at that
     ball, while i had the honour of dancing with you, i was first made
     acquainted, by sir william lucas's accidental information, that
     bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general
     expectation of their marriage.	4900.7138671875
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr.
hurst had a house.	4930.359375
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.	5208.97265625
but you know married women have never much time for
writing.	5111.27734375
but to be sure,
the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming
character!	4658.173828125
"it will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said miss lucas.	4487.21728515625
she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay.	5138.50048828125
but what is that to me?	4816.818359375
consider mr. collins's respectability, and
charlotte's prudent, steady character.	5725.986328125
"this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,"
said he.	5706.1923828125
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	4655.2470703125
"and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"	5253.8037109375
"oh!	4536.38916015625
he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.	4093.2001953125
the power of doing any thing with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.	4901.30712890625
miss bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
good will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
two eldest.	1272.3896484375
at night she opened her heart to jane.	4145.53564453125
only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.	4481.80712890625
it is what every body says.	4326.3291015625
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held.	4936.49462890625
my sister, who is more than ten years my
     junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, colonel
     fitzwilliam, and myself.	4666.3857421875
what is it you are talking
of?	4786.138671875
"my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	4333.04736328125
to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever.	4415.724609375
this is your final resolve!	4755.904296875
"i knew," said he, "that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary.	4675.92333984375
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out,
as likely to give any news of him.	4432.5673828125
that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr. bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.	4507.9208984375
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	5410.3359375
mr. bennet made no answer.	5001.05712890625
bennet."	4159.2568359375
said she, as she looked in
her face.	4967.96240234375
in the desperation
of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to
elizabeth, said,

"miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.--i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting
so long in one attitude."	5008.24462890625
now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.	4773.3525390625
little more than half a day's
journey.	4689.72314453125
lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her
party.	4905.6611328125
had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.	4442.39404296875
you and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the
party."	4451.99169921875
for
     about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the
     incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied
     to me again by letter for the presentation.	4709.5869140625
those to her mother, contained little else, than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs. forster called her, and they were going to the
camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less
to be learnt--for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.	4841.45751953125
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet's carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up
stairs.	4236.5693359375
it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment.	5180.2939453125
1813.	5602.40869140625
the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen."	5334.9462890625
they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.	3882.040771484375
"my fingers," said elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women's do.	4555.060546875
she read, with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.	4901.06884765625
darcy made no answer.	4960.03759765625
mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.	4728.8994140625
had his character been known, this could not
have happened.	4449.5634765625
we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	5880.048828125
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.	4584.8447265625
she could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	4280.919921875
elizabeth privately added, "and how much i shall have to conceal."	4615.73876953125
there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,

"when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."	4078.549072265625
another day i will do the same; i will sit in
my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble
as i can,--or, perhaps, i may defer it, till kitty runs away."	5757.2900390625
she was very
equal therefore to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	4633.958984375
"indeed i am.	6714.00341796875
so far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.	4816.712890625
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	4460.716796875
cried elizabeth.	4345.95068359375
you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names
to be mentioned in your hearing."	5420.939453125
tell him i hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	5999.00244140625
"no indeed; i felt nothing but surprise."	4240.78564453125
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share.	4950.3408203125
her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
increased by every review of it.	4985.1669921875
"very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"	7196.33154296875
did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in kent?"	4441.3095703125
mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	5225.541015625
at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving mr.
darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
dancing and his partner.	5042.294921875
they were, therefore, to go.--elizabeth was pleased, though,
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	4764.3115234375
this letter is from mr.	5099.21728515625
"i did not know that you intended to walk," said miss bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.	4117.1796875
i hate such false
friends.	4866.0458984375
the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr. wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.	4633.892578125
"mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.	4333.291015625
"my dear," replied her husband, "i have two small favours to request.	5330.857421875
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	5041.3623046875
"certainly.	4717.30517578125
well, monday morning came, and i was in
such a fuss!	4767.81591796875
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with

"it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr.	4208.71435546875
the children have been wanting me this half hour.	5326.7001953125
"no.	3552.68505859375
the present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware,
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia's infamy somewhat better.	5476.19482421875
if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence.	6083.9033203125
but i make no doubt, they
often talk of it between themselves.	3792.18212890625
it was only said, 'lately,
george wickham, esq.	4480.4140625
"no, she would go home.	4977.36669921875
"he is as fine a fellow," said mr. bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever i saw.	5925.40380859375
my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"	4506.32666015625
sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that
as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	4608.11669921875
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.	4188.26611328125
chapter xviii.	4248.70751953125
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary.	4564.4833984375
thank heaven!	5238.1748046875
mrs. bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
bingley's behaviour to jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	4598.9541015625
"it is _not_ mr. bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life."	4474.27392578125
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not.	5737.8916015625
cried
jane.	4485.958984375
it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.	4811.20361328125
give me farther particulars.	5899.6015625
elizabeth could not help saying, "it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so."	4620.7861328125
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.	5423.8095703125
would to heaven that any
thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer
consolation to such distress.--but i will not torment you with vain
wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	4942.5244140625
"indeed!"	4147.86083984375
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield, in the course of three or four
months.	5122.916015625
"i see what you are feeling," replied charlotte,--"you must be
surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as mr. collins was wishing to
marry you.	4522.34619140625
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.	4600.814453125
said lydia stoutly, "i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i'm the tallest."	5169.28369140625
at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,

"mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
_making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain."	4961.01220703125
it was all
     over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _your's_ seems to have been.	4775.21044921875
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	4551.54296875
it was dated
from rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

     "be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
     apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments,
     or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to
     you.	4862.69677734375
"can you come to-morrow?"	4919.54736328125
elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure.	4228.9482421875
"i suspected as much," replied elizabeth.	4419.59619140625
i thought i should have broke my heart."	4810.06591796875
i have a warm, unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.	5864.48046875
her power
was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	4776.37646484375
my father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be.	4963.73828125
oh!	4617.09912109375
not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive.	4158.5908203125
"she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	5964.51220703125
"you take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said darcy in
a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	4658.74658203125
for
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to every body.	4374.9267578125
sir, i do indeed.	5386.4736328125
"how strange!"	5677.13671875
if you should have no objection to receive me
     into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on
     you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o'clock, and
     shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday
     se'night following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as
     lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
     sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the
     duty of the day.	2894.13037109375
you are
not well enough;--you cannot go yourself."	4748.91552734375
elizabeth made no answer.	5288.318359375
she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	5384.16748046875
it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved,
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.	4578.849609375
"_you_ began the evening well, charlotte," said mrs. bennet with civil
self-command to miss lucas.	6294.849609375
the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised;
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs. bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.	4497.833984375
she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances:--and to have mr. collins
instead!	5933.427734375
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations
of thread-bare morality to listen to.	4857.97314453125
perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.	4827.970703125
one seems so forlorn without them."	4945.5654296875
"you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	4101.96533203125
"and they _must_ marry!	4688.7255859375
vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.	4797.4033203125
"all this she must possess," added darcy, "and to all this she must yet
add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."	4507.8525390625
to know
that her daughter would be married was enough.	4313.689453125
"how can you talk so?"	5323.46044921875
"i hope not."	4590.47509765625
chapter xvii.	4929.9267578125
my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.	4615.7607421875
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints
can have no great inclination for talking.	4488.88623046875
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it.	3436.550048828125
but i suppose you had no opportunity.	4367.97314453125
"no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose.	4386.2900390625
1.f.3.	5448.69970703125
what is your own opinion?"	4563.1953125
she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either.	3988.63916015625
mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.	2838.890380859375
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.	3901.5
your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."	5731.0830078125
whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.	5013.0185546875
it was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.	3844.70703125
he
bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr. darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.	4009.527587890625
"i do not blame jane," she continued, "for jane would have got mr.
bingley, if she could.	5501.83984375
from something that he told me in
our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him.	4604.048828125
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.	6124.484375
"undoubtedly," replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.	5919.388671875
she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it.	4210.9228515625
dear me!	4679.51904296875
"yes, very handsome."	4845.35595703125
you
may have drawn him in."	4796.94140625
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr. gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist
mr. bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.	4858.45068359375
to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.	4828.01220703125
"i should be sorry indeed, if it were.	3962.8642578125
"my aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor-street."	5818.021484375
"bingley."	4026.91748046875
it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane's
attractions.	4543.26416015625
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a
presumption!	5890.943359375
"mr.
collins moreover adds," "i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally
known.	4694.3994140625
well, well, i only hope it
will last.	4533.24072265625
adieu.	5444.689453125
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr. bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.	4600.3623046875
international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states.	4238.56591796875
with the gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	1375.7852783203125
_invented by m^{rs} bell 26 charlotte street bedford square._

_engraved for no.	4291.90380859375
"but how did he account for
it?"	5044.2529296875
on finding
mrs. bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,

"may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"	4715.3349609375
"compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn, never wanted the means.	4678.10009765625
well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	5270.03759765625
mary and kitty, thank
heaven!	4954.69091796875
for your
sake," turning to charlotte, "i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh's family.--do you play and sing, miss
bennet?"	5210.7314453125
"you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before any body and every body!--if my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers."	5570.09228515625
well!	4822.48583984375
"he made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."	4680.353515625
"_that_ is a failing indeed!"	4603.5439453125
oh,
lord!	4511.3271484375
pray go to see them, with sir william and maria.	4548.40576171875
from
what can it proceed?	4673.31103515625
chapter xvi.	4044.529296875
"we will be down as soon as we can," said jane; "but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."	5131.31640625
it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention.	4190.4716796875
the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	6207.6025390625
the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.	5236.3662109375
darcy."	4571.12255859375
"i am trying to make it out."	5981.435546875
"you look pale.	4642.1064453125
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon
regained her composure, and calmly replied,

"why should you be surprised, my dear eliza?--do you think it incredible
that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	4167.64697265625
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.	4916.83642578125
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	3620.73486328125
their sister's wedding day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself.	5129.66748046875
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters.	5113.53466796875
poor kitty has anger for having concealed
     their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot
     wonder.	4183.8310546875
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley.	5091.0927734375
i really do not think georgiana
darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
affection she inspires in louisa and myself, is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of
her being hereafter our sister.	5305.3515625
mrs.
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.--against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	4345.3291015625
the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this.	4729.521484375
the
housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the
arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot
there for several weeks.	4458.27978515625

gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.e.8.	5387.7529296875
"you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour."	4696.21728515625
but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not.	5651.80078125
you know not what you are
about."	5339.8125
chapter ii.	5257.86376953125
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his
having slighted one of her daughters.	5267.5654296875
but now it was all too natural.	4592.77880859375
shocking!"	4776.0302734375
if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.	4660.4931640625
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	4179.5556640625
"you are mistaken.	5157.25439453125
they were ignorant, idle, and vain.	4270.7216796875

colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.	4201.0390625
"pride," observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing i believe.	4695.43359375
"whatever i do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes.	5071.23486328125
it became her turn to listen.	5080.56787109375
the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	4691.91064453125
"i believe, ma'am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."	3969.703125
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.	5290.2802734375
"we never had any governess."	3917.640625
as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	5109.60546875
i am sincerely grieved for him and
     mrs. f. but no one can throw any blame on them.	4964.71826171875
we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.	4871.50634765625
elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view.	4736.02099609375
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion.	4135.30859375
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire.	5234.888671875
stay, stay, i will go myself.	4471.51806640625
"lady catherine de bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
living.	4693.1904296875
"this is not to be borne.	5045.72021484375
i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman.	4961.79296875
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	6424.4365234375
i pity, though i
     cannot help blaming her.	4292.80029296875
but the horror of what might possibly happen,
almost took from me my faculties."	4897.1630859375
miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
enough to leave her room.	4560.9892578125
chapter xv.	6341.0693359375
"you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed i am quite of your opinion.	4769.27099609375
lydia's being settled in the
north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with every body, and had so many favourites.	4881.10498046875
1.f.6.	4889.31396484375
1.e.3.	5102.12158203125
but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	4948.0751953125
i never
in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	3649.710205078125
come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.	4060.4365234375
mrs. gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly.	6531.8271484375
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	3924.72705078125
they were in fact very fine ladies; not
deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	5830.1962890625
"exceed their income!	5643.646484375
such
doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly.	4149.5029296875
both sisters were uncomfortable
enough.	4696.92041015625
i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the
country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.	4507.88232421875
it appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best.	5284.2802734375
i do not trust my own
partiality.	5046.98095703125
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country town indifference to decorum."	4729.2236328125
darcy?"	4891.59912109375
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon
charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.	6057.34765625
"wickham so
very bad!	4791.39990234375
how rich
and how great you will be!	4712.421875
you
mentioned _two_ instances.	5879.34765625
this, she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better.	4087.115234375
"if i were as rich as mr. darcy," cried a young lucas who came with his
sisters, "i should not care how proud i was.	4075.010986328125

chapter vii.	4064.934814453125
"if you were to give me forty such men, i never could be so happy as
you.	4118.59716796875
"do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?	4510.62158203125
brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton."	4456.8173828125
jane now came up.	5521.7666015625
march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford.	5067.98583984375
i _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.	4461.814453125
have a little
compassion on my nerves.	5965.4677734375
mr. collins and charlotte appeared at
the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a
short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
party.	4776.2080078125
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging.	4712.0400390625
the officers may not be so pleasant in general ----'s
regiment."	4672.39306640625
what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?	4326.8779296875
then, perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false
step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded
in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."	5066.458984375
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
     have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
     it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
     towards mr. wickham.	5344.63232421875

how i long to see her!	4553.41015625
my temper i dare not vouch
for.--it is i believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.	3970.70263671875
at that moment, she cared for no other.	4973.513671875
but i have
other provocations.	5061.6201171875
"i am talking of possibilities, charles."	4307.30908203125
lydia was lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and
fearless.	5067.54638671875
"i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--i must be in town
next saturday."	4743.32080078125
let me hear what it is."	5108.3095703125
"really, mr. collins," cried elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly.	4016.50048828125
'ah!	4171.0185546875
he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!	3704.392822265625
"my style of writing is very different from yours."	4511.25830078125
darcy!"	4785.79638671875
she was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and
confidence subsisted between mr. darcy and herself.	4662.21337890625
mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.	5290.99169921875
did she call to refuse her consent?"	4475.5966796875
i am perfectly serious in my refusal.--you could not make _me_
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.--nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."	4192.146484375
at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.	5250.8837890625
with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round.	4410.3876953125
i know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	4700.13330078125
"but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	4818.32080078125
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	4733.19921875
darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	5343.82177734375
it was not known that wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept
up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	3923.196533203125
"this is the consequence you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said
elizabeth.	4727.0595703125
my dear lizzy, they must
     have passed within ten miles of us.	4243.11962890625
"it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it."	5179.50341796875
"i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."	4721.4775390625
in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg-tm and future generations.	3952.5
its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, and
unable to utter a syllable.	5646.10107421875
every thing
that is charming!	4628.05859375
the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.	4122.47216796875
miss lucas perceived
him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly
set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	3809.10888671875
miss darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it.	4099.751953125
"i told you the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	4185.8623046875
she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him.	4951.30859375
he could number the fields in every direction,
and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	4931.2431640625
_they_ will
take care not to outrun their income.	5106.19091796875
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	5195.14111328125
"you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan."	4196.7626953125
"but what is to be
done about pemberley?"	4516.880859375
he only meant that there were not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true."	4711.88720703125
in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "go to your father, he
wants you in the library."	4443.380859375
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when
he speaks.	4758.9755859375
lady
catherine de bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.	4441.220703125
"with all my heart; i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it."	4546.818359375
the apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	4020.827392578125
elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	4693.86181640625
nothing occurred between
them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	4151.68359375
mr. darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	4575.47509765625
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins, for she vows she will
not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_."	4757.40576171875
they soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.	5189.7236328125
and is it really true?	4641.67724609375
charlotte the wife of mr. collins,
was a most humiliating picture!--and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.	5142.20654296875
and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment.	4633.28759765625
at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."	4883.51220703125
jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever.	5556.2607421875
if it was
not for the entail i should not mind it."	4180.26123046875
he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.	4998.37744140625
well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	6285.9111328125
after a short silence, the lady first spoke.	4797.56787109375
"no"--said darcy, "i have made no such pretension.	6050.9853515625
cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	4659.09765625
i was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	5424.98876953125
rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit.	4458.73486328125
in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost.	5936.6708984375
my aunt philips came to longbourn
on tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me.	4457.7822265625
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	4017.151611328125
at length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	4026.18017578125
she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr. wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantle-piece.	3840.661376953125
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine, frankly and openly."	5240.5380859375
to kitty, however, it does not
     seem so wholly unexpected.	4662.84912109375
he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits.	4730.49609375
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did lydia,
assisted by kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn.	4297.0234375
i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	4421.1728515625
having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.	4945.697265625
"it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference, but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	4023.784912109375
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	4451.70703125
she followed him with
her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself
for being so silly!	5208.84814453125
you may imagine what i felt
     and how i acted.	5312.03466796875
it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day."	4768.03857421875
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project
gutenberg-tm license when you share it without charge with others.	4762.158203125
but our visitor
     was very obstinate.	4690.0498046875
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	5009.17626953125
i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	4715.60498046875
mr.
collins then returned to elizabeth.	4347.6005859375
and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	4933.21875
his wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of
the highest kind.	4766.9521484375
you have employed your
time much better.	5401.77783203125
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.	4551.6298828125
he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention."	4439.916015625
"i do, i do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "i love him.	5336.94140625
"nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said elizabeth.	4570.0283203125
"is he married or single?"	4361.56689453125
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can
think any thing wanting.	4244.1435546875
mr. darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	4810.01513671875
"i am afraid you do not like your pen.	4561.11572265625
elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more.	5102.7880859375
"oh!--you mean jane, i suppose--because he danced with her twice.	4712.1611328125
"when i am in the country," he replied, "i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town it is pretty much the same.	5239.9033203125
your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	4686.00341796875
"no, no.	3767.04443359375
"do not you want to know who has taken it?"	5162.4208984375
i
thank you for explaining it so fully.	5008.99951171875
"i should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	4080.69677734375
"that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	4435.29052734375
but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them.	5391.06787109375
mr. wickham's attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.	5229.7041015625
"it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas's."	5102.12158203125
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs.	4896.64453125
but do not imagine
that he is always here so often.	4274.43359375
but she is nothing to me now.	5157.94287109375
but really, ma'am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.--the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of
youth, as the first.	4871.31591796875
"miss eliza bennet," said miss bingley, "despises cards.	4703.541015625
how wonderfully these sort of things occur!	4967.162109375
"yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	4504.29833984375
since her
father's death, her home has been london, where a lady lives with her,
and superintends her education."	4362.84814453125
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance.	3951.3466796875
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	4609.94091796875
i cannot be
     otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your
     amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to
     assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but
     of this hereafter.	4064.7216796875
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	4490.6845703125
"well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	5299.177734375
"and do you like her?"	5467.73046875
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are
on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	5172.43505859375
they both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered.	3692.13671875
between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular
regard.	4218.74462890625
"i beg you would not put it into lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.	4395.75
find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.'	4948.65576171875
it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."	4518.26806640625
"but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model.	4684.1181640625
cried wickham with a look which did not escape her.	4361.69580078125
chapter vii.	4416.2509765625
"my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expence, when i confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in miss bingley's regard for me.	4691.4052734375
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do.	4533.14111328125
he was
angry.	4788.08837890625
in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name; but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	4755.70458984375
to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men."	4394.2998046875
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil?	5086.16259765625
"if you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.	5879.6337890625
"it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began.	4524.615234375
--a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again.	4514.0126953125
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	4718.78564453125
miss darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	5434.89501953125
cried jane, "what do you mean, sir?"	4536.484375
he was on one side of her mother.	4480.86669921875
"what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?"	4549.15185546875
"but so we all do.	4170.8076171875
teazing, teazing, man!	4339.37841796875
"it is evident by this," added jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."	4715.9873046875
he knows of my
     being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy.	3804.084716796875
the dejection was almost
universal.	4537.36669921875
and to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--i think it
would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind."	4272.64013671875
"if we are ever able to learn what wickham's debts have been," said
elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own.	4435.2314453125
elizabeth related to jane the next day, what had passed between mr.
wickham and herself.	4140.68359375
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship.	5100.1171875
for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	5423.224609375
"well, then--supposing them to be in london.	4687.322265625
"i should like it beyond any thing!"	6506.4296875
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	5144.99755859375
"not so hasty, if you please.	4683.88134765625
there can be no love in all this.	4635.33349609375
sir william did not say much.	5228.158203125
i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."	4020.7314453125
she followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	4901.6298828125
she seldom listened to any
body for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.	4430.8896484375
i know you will contrive it all."	6039.51220703125
"you have only proved by this," cried elizabeth, "that mr. bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.	4223.7041015625
to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
farther.	4746.59716796875
"mr. darcy
is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are
scarcely less eager to meet her again.	2898.7392578125
but they did pass away, and mr. and
mrs. gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn.	4359.16748046875
you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them."	4751.244140625
and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	3282.317138671875
"oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	4954.052734375
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces.	4793.57080078125
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in, and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.	4618.6845703125
there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	4553.64013671875
"it is a long time, mr. bingley, since you went away," said mrs. bennet.	5357.42578125
but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."	4815.12353515625
let me do it without farther loss of time.	5746.0126953125
their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.	4446.77685546875
"and have you answered the letter?"	4892.26171875
"are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"	4714.8896484375
you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."	5624.818359375
this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	5257.20703125
mr. darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	5111.65234375
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs. bennet give up the point.	4739.4912109375
"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?--do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."	6397.91943359375
there was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner
which gave them meaning.	4779.03271484375
"books--oh!	5184.109375
"i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley's conduct to design,"
said elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	5050.86181640625
come be quick, be quick!	5063.662109375
one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."	4651.11572265625
we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."	4316.18701171875
miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; mr. darcy looked
up.	5467.14111328125
"no, i believe not."	4685.0205078125
we have judged it best, that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
     approve.	4198.40771484375

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.	5462.8935546875
at that moment they were met from another walk, by mrs. hurst and
elizabeth herself.	5183.27880859375
on this subject, what can you have to
say?	3936.90283203125
i have told miss bennet several times, that
she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though
mrs. collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often
told her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in
mrs. jenkinson's room.	5319.83154296875
they will
ruin your happiness.	4242.423828125
"but depend upon it, mr. collins," she added, "that lizzy shall be
brought to reason.	6099.16455078125
"my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	4619.87841796875
cried mrs. bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley!	4373.4541015625
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr. wickham.	5633.08544921875
but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."	4166.16845703125
"you are over scrupulous surely.	4669.2529296875
my dear charlotte,--impossible!"	4810.02001953125
darcy was fixed in astonishment.	4885.32861328125
where there is fortune to make the expence of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	6406.72412109375
from that moment i
     observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and i could then
     perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had
     ever witnessed in him.	4837.17431640625
i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself.	4441.5
if he fears me, why come hither?	4689.86181640625
mrs. hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy's eyes were fixed
on her.	4974.576171875
it is useless to talk of it."	4517.7939453125
elizabeth was distressed.	6424.4365234375
"and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"	3096.095703125
they entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	5844.67578125
"if you mean darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses,
before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and
as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my
cards."	5017.806640625

bingley.--it was an animating subject, and mrs.
bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
the match.	4440.064453125
a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.	4985.0908203125
mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton.	6229.931640625
"but not before they went to brighton?"	4004.0478515625
it was mr. collins's picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.	4800.25927734375
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.	5233.98486328125

let _our_ first effusions be less

on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.	5037.97412109375
elizabeth could bear it no longer.	5111.140625
she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
miss bingley.	4179.28857421875
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	4108.84033203125
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way.	4642.40771484375
this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr. bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	4521.552734375
lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a
large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	4442.43212890625
mr. darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would
hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, mr. bingley
never stirs without him."	5218.26025390625
mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	4136.75244140625
darcy?"	4871.3017578125
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	3983.465576171875
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse.	5218.21044921875
her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive any thing
extraordinary in them.	4313.845703125
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy."	5240.7177734375
nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.	4028.2578125
but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	4900.24609375
he was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;
but it had not been so in derbyshire.	4347.9033203125
seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.	5591.16259765625
other schemes too came into her head.	4245.900390625
charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,

"i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility.	4066.241455078125
it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.	4380.62548828125
the younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte's
dying an old maid.	5064.1259765625
"this fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."	6248.04931640625
chapter v.


within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate.	4203.7646484375
and so, you like this man's sisters too,
do you?	4404.02001953125

conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none.	5689.5810546875
my dear aunt, how could you think of it?	4284.6611328125
"miss bennet, do you know who i am?	4058.268798828125
i declare i do not
know a more aweful object than darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening
when he has nothing to do."	4934.6494140625
could she exert herself it would be better, but
     this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in my life
     saw him so affected.	4552.9150390625
"my motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	4722.4501953125
elizabeth quietly answered "undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.	4805.92529296875
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	4400.7666015625
"i assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	4793.77197265625
"your picture may be very exact, louisa," said bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me.	4841.8173828125
very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.	4190.93505859375
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

lydia declared herself satisfied.	4530.25830078125
"that is very true," replied elizabeth, "and i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."	4196.38232421875
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger.	4758.31298828125
she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had mr. wickham
appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation,
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows."	4836.79638671875
1.b.	6712.62060546875
you do not look
well.	4624.12353515625
and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	4248.314453125
the
wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions,
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke."	4727.578125
the conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard mr. darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport.	4959.01611328125
we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word.	6584.39404296875
"design!	5117.5302734375
but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	5972.29296875
i am only ashamed of his asking so little."	4868.74755859375
the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you.	4355.16162109375
many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.	4646.4384765625
if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that
jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	4955.583984375
yes, yes.	4514.48193359375
i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."	5174.1767578125
"then," observed elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."	4319.1435546875
darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	4572.09033203125
it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs.
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	5767.55029296875
jane, i take your place now, and you must go
lower, because i am a married woman."	4768.3115234375
"now i have got some news for you," said lydia, as they sat down to
table.	4074.758544921875
i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding.	4897.466796875
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.	3324.240234375
mr. darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life!	5603.29541015625
"good gracious!	5132.77978515625
she could only imagine however
at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
in any other person present.	4787.787109375
chapter xix.	4630.98583984375
but so they always are.	4092.59521484375
"yes, i have had a letter from him by express."	4601.30126953125
but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."	5757.01025390625
his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	4210.1435546875
"and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"	4808.32763671875
do
you often dance at st.	4615.28564453125
my dear, dear
lydia!--how merry we shall be together when we meet!"	5106.0009765625
with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs. bingley and talked of mrs. darcy may be guessed.	4448.146484375
elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running down stairs
from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	4828.70751953125
and taking her hand, he would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,

"indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing.--i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner."	4432.84228515625
she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible.	4559.96728515625
"in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."	7058.25244140625
"and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	3368.484375
there are a few
things that you can do with most project gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	6088.81396484375
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr. darcy's civility, and above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	5038.2529296875
this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much.	5166.0166015625
i am happier even than jane; she only smiles, i
     laugh.	4175.72314453125
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage, for mr. collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow
as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great
intelligence.	4185.994140625
jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	6532.2626953125
the moral will be perfectly fair.	5277.24462890625
how mr. darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.	5361.560546875
"and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?"	5853.16015625
but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.	4966.97705078125
i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	4565.02783203125
to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself.	6465.3837890625
"i dare say you will find him very agreeable."	4520.34130859375
"we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said elizabeth.	4889.72412109375
how acutely did she now
feel it.	4959.58837890625
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
any thing else.	4004.170166015625
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	4199.44091796875
poor charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to
such society!--but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though
evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to
ask for compassion.	5799.8505859375
what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have!	4502.966796875
she dreaded seeing wickham again,
and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	4472.90869140625
i was not in a humour to
wait for any opening of your's.	4331.31591796875
elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.--lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	4736.08447265625
"you must not be too severe upon yourself," replied elizabeth.	3869.654541015625
why did she come?	4551.54296875
upon the whole, i am much pleased with him."	4455.15576171875
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld!	3674.87109375
"do you suppose them to be in london?"	4453.07421875
"how hard it is in some cases to be believed!"	4547.5166015625
elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	5244.4423828125
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	4868.91455078125
said she.	5588.09716796875
as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more.	4517.94482421875
my temper
would perhaps be called resentful.--my good opinion once lost is lost
for ever."	4728.1142578125
you take
delight in vexing me.	4838.8447265625
he has also _brotherly_ pride,
which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful
guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."	6424.35107421875
"it has been a very agreeable day," said miss bennet to elizabeth.	5664.9296875
i wish i could see her.	4352.20947265625
having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	4630.31005859375
such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.	5670.31884765625
"this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"	4667.3916015625
and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north.	4860.169921875
can you, yourself, lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"	4832.45751953125
his
reception however was of the most flattering kind.	5062.85107421875
the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	4378.28271484375
"my dear sir," replied mr. collins, "i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."	4154.4443359375
"well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband?	4523.35986328125
mr. darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.	5988.9814453125
mrs. bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	4117.49365234375
he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.	4400.7412109375
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to mr. bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her.	4537.12890625
you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	4997.3955078125
if your abhorrence of
     _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented
     by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may
     be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour to find
     some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course
     of the morning.	4621.7998046875
they returned therefore in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.	4966.138671875
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.	6890.0615234375
but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.	4652.17138671875
"but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?"	5167.8837890625
mr. bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	4182.4267578125
it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be
remarked, he meant to make enquiries at clapham.	4879.36865234375
upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been
sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward
with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself.	4513.29833984375
it
was all pride and insolence.	5309.2236328125
what i have to say relates to
     poor lydia.	5081.59033203125
"yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable.	4730.37841796875
but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.	4776.11669921875
he placed himself by her.	5551.6474609375
"your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds."	6056.666015625
i shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point.	4726.99169921875
i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not.	3891.322265625
elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?	4556.763671875
"indeed, you are mistaken, madam.	4131.94580078125
but you do not know _all_.	5145.669921875
when my niece georgiana went to
ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men servants go
with her.--miss darcy, the daughter of mr. darcy, of pemberley, and lady
anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--i
am excessively attentive to all those things.	5178.357421875
what does he say?	4129.8935546875
"your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said darcy, "has
too much truth.	5533.4853515625
"wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her
sister.	5036.763671875
she added, "by far too much.	4365.5908203125
darcy!--my father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it.	4985.26171875
they must have seen them together for ever."	5800.1103515625
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	5346.87548828125
is it true?"	4103.05322265625
it was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	5131.673828125
have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"	5031.55419921875
but it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."	4543.32470703125
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but as he took up his abode with the lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet.	4687.93896484375
but i dare not
hope it.	4745.82763671875
she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter.	4731.8857421875
when she was discontented she
fancied herself nervous.	4768.60693359375
elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.	4296.74462890625
if an
individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are
located in the united states, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg
are removed.	5184.287109375
"you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"	4449.10986328125
mr. darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public.	4422.26513671875
in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are
seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist?	4837.88037109375
catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.	5583.111328125
in comparing her recollection of pemberley, with the
minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.	4768.58447265625
"it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."	4246.9453125
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr.
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the
affair became public.	4605.1953125
its banks
were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	5210.1650390625
to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.	4594.89892578125
you never see a fault in any body.	4792.93994140625
he heard her with astonishment.	5246.29833984375
he
arranges the business just as he pleases."	3755.29345703125
mr. darcy asked him why he had not married your
     sister at once.	4037.711669921875
he seldom appeared really
animated.	4551.8818359375
i have no such injuries to resent.	4379.77783203125
at present i will
say nothing about it."	4560.9765625
susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough.	5092.3359375
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."	4896.9482421875
we have heard nothing from town."	4407.537109375
she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.	6424.4365234375
they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	4909.1943359375
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,

"you are mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner."	4821.634765625
"you certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."	4373.1455078125
you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_."	5278.29150390625
"why, i must confess, that i love him better than i do bingley.	4755.5732421875
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	5243.99755859375
there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs. philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every
body.	4550.27587890625
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.	5237.4951171875
which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	4488.88623046875
i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married.	5146.52880859375
we must not make him desperate."	5009.9599609375
certainly," said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."	4303.77001953125
do any thing rather than
marry without affection.	4603.0654296875
it is impossible that he should still love
me."	4448.64306640625
you shall not defend her,
though it is charlotte lucas.	5120.88916015625
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	4437.21142578125
i had not an idea of it."	5429.708984375
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr.
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr. darcy's
looks and behaviour.	4596.078125
mr.
darcy may hug himself."	5323.419921875
her aunt now called her to look at a picture.	4702.03857421875
of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	5434.18505859375
soon after
     you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of london they were.	3172.5234375
your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."	4422.3701171875
last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."	5216.6728515625
darcy?"	5105.650390625
she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they
should meet.	4663.765625
you are safe from me."	4479.3671875
when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.	4870.87939453125
"complied with!	3875.744873046875
you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner.	3910.9921875
to be sure london was
rather thin, but however the little theatre was open.	5268.791015625
every girl in, or near meryton, was out of her senses about him
for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any
particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of
extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others
of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her
favourites."	4322.64599609375
"yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.	4453.3037109375
dear me!	5937.888671875
"while i can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--i
think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	4360.47705078125
very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	5087.79736328125
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
i assure you.	5959.0087890625
"and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."	5339.2880859375
at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."	4738.6005859375
they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same.	5151.3310546875
"it may perhaps be pleasant," replied charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.	4613.68359375
"true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	4452.900390625
shall you like to have such a brother?"	3499.624267578125
into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	4298.3720703125
"oh!"	4735.75927734375
lord!	5034.68896484375
"does that young lady know mr.	5313.580078125
"yes, and i had heard it before.	5572.6640625
i dare say mr. bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy."	6250.26025390625
i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right.	4736.55859375
how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!	4302.419921875
i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."	5101.04638671875
but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.	4718.9921875
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	4671.359375
said elizabeth.	4206.51953125
"and yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand
them."	4380.763671875
wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three very silly
sisters.	4292.8291015625
i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.	5165.9326171875
on opening the door, she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would
have told it all.	6580.46435546875
"and mary king is safe!"	5660.86328125
"tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley's."	4844.35302734375
when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
farther to wish.	4468.287109375
elizabeth almost stared at her.--"can this be mr.	5126.2392578125
to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed i rather believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr.	4147.287109375

wickham's affection for lydia, was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia's for him.	4237.0458984375
i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."	4880.74169921875
elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time.	5246.46875
but it is of small importance."	4238.5537109375
when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing.	4688.7705078125
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	3934.294189453125
i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"	4171.166015625
chapter xii.	3811.2783203125
do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"	4227.8671875
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.	5207.51220703125
"about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i
answered it, for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention.	4639.5
though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if i was
her, i would not have put up with it.	4403.2431640625
such was miss lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.	6177.53076171875
were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	6410.140625
she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what.	4311.39013671875
miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry miss darcy.	4474.734375
"your plan is a good one," replied elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it.	4286.2880859375
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the
son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr. darcy afterwards discharged.	5147.9033203125
the particulars, i reserve till we meet.	4860.91162109375
"aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	4413.7919921875
she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	4933.9013671875
mrs. bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again.--but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	2818.048828125
but i hope you will not mind it: it is
all for jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him, except just now and then.	5076.29638671875
"no--why should he?	5306.1611328125
he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed
himself to have attained it.	4308.08984375
they will have nothing else to
do."	3986.426025390625
"lizzy," said her father, "i have given him my consent.	4836.46875
"i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	4677.92626953125
the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met.	4847.9208984375
but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool's errand again."	5420.4013671875
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	5407.83935546875
let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."	5170.47705078125
he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	5075.4443359375
"miss bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that i am not to be trifled with.	4764.0068359375
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."	4720.955078125
"have you any other objection," said elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"	5050.08154296875
he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	5517.013671875
they walked on, without knowing in what direction.	5462.4453125
1.f.5.	4587.99365234375
she now lost every expectation of pleasure.	4943.556640625
sir william only smiled.	4141.71435546875
miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied.	4408.1298828125
she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	4469.03271484375
mrs. hurst
thought the same, and added,

"she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.	5846.8505859375
"this is a wretched beginning indeed!	4456.29052734375
"_you_ go to brighton!--i would not trust you so near it as east bourne
for fifty pounds!	5396.345703125
some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw any thing of it.	4332.13818359375
oh!	1371.7232666015625
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth, and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
make.--attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to
wickham.	4167.2216796875
she related the subject
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain.	5485.7861328125
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any
one.	4741.353515625
your's, very
     sincerely,

     "m.	4873.439453125
and now here's mr. bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all?	4399.85595703125
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet, and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before,

"i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	4706.83447265625
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say, and so passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	4400.611328125
--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.	4584.67822265625
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "oh!	4855.00439453125
"there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.	5156.482421875
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.	4336.2919921875
in three volumes.	5531.99755859375
in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."	4658.08935546875
with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	5158.095703125
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very
agreeable companion.	5078.421875
colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the day
     before, not many hours after the express.	4935.5341796875
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized.	4969.142578125
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	4415.4716796875
they were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	4741.82861328125
and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?"	3922.83349609375
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it.	6199.50341796875
"it is amazing to me," said bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished, as they all are."	5375.9375
wickham is safe."	5438.74755859375
a report of a most
alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	4714.81787109375
lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."	4240.4580078125
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy.	4476.134765625
mrs. collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure."	5083.0107421875
gardiner."	5357.0986328125
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	5665.4970703125
she repeated.	5089.626953125
the supposition did not pain her.	4574.09228515625
i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."	4375.0810546875
lydia,
my love, ring the bell.	5567.26171875
it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining.	4636.0146484375
you agree that the foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage.	4957.06787109375
the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	5185.904296875
unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)
i was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own.	4631.123046875
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs. collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much.	4093.516357421875
he began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	4625.20849609375
"what, none of you?"	4695.4423828125
she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.	4073.15380859375
mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	3999.212646484375
"'tis an etiquette i despise," said he.	4397.41845703125
but i
cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london.	3449.84228515625
darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	5021.44921875
"my dearest child," she cried, "i can think of nothing else!	5019.02685546875
"his manners are very different from his cousin's."	4224.7197265625
jane," cried elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"	5466.96923828125
i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	3875.667236328125
day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs.
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.	4183.91064453125
"i dare say you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.	5110.38525390625
1.e.5.	4359.37109375
when she thought
of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr.
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr. bingley for his sister.	6161.5625
"aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and mrs. long does not come back
till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."	3851.187744140625
he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter."	4438.35400390625
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.	4688.779296875
but, alas!	4520.73779296875
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	5160.77197265625
mr. darcy was almost as far from her, as the table
could divide them.	4910.4541015625
i have by no means done.	3980.0859375
they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens."	4493.64501953125
very well.	4515.56689453125
for the truth of every thing here related, i can appeal more
     particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam, who from our
     near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of
     the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
     with every particular of these transactions.	4453.06591796875
from herself to jane--from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy's explanation
_there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	6114.01513671875
pride and prejudice:

a novel.	4432.87158203125
since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
     easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	4695.20068359375
"i should not mind any thing at all."	3904.306640625
"and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley.	3847.63037109375
mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when
she found herself so affectionately received.	4854.91650390625
she enquired into charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice,
as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be
regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.	3753.5068359375
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.	4673.671875
"i am glad i bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!	4271.61767578125
bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object.	7304.69580078125
"yes--if darcy does not put it off again.	5583.8037109375
if it was not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"	5366.9169921875
"i am all astonishment.	3851.771728515625
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good.	4434.271484375
he cannot know what mr.
darcy is."	4143.29833984375
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.	5127.77978515625
i hope they will not meet at all.	4595.47314453125
he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."	4913.4658203125
and pray what sort of guardians do you make?	4082.65478515625
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention.	5005.2509765625
"thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	5346.130859375
but of this answer lydia heard not a word.	4109.42041015625
i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after.	3964.296875
she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	4777.1962890625
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head.	4394.0693359375
"why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"	3597.53271484375
he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.	5136.0166015625
tell him what a dreadful state i am in,--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day.	4339.8623046875
he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry.	4247.650390625
there's for you!	4863.54052734375
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,

"i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley!	4797.115234375
mrs. gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley's visit in gracechurch-street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.	4667.28955078125
his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.	4167.75830078125
my dear," cried his wife, "i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	5194.9677734375
their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute enquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.	4842.95361328125
brother-in-law of wickham!	4814.072265625
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected.	4173.01611328125
mr. darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together.	4279.2177734375
"undoubtedly.	3745.21142578125
there was no help
for it however.	4731.529296875
i.	4275.224609375
then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	4868.3017578125
"we are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.	4874.0341796875
but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.	6096.134765625
"she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property."	3860.826171875
- you provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.f.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.	4143.4052734375
they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,

"if you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."	6192.16455078125
i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.	4957.0068359375
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley.	4890.68505859375
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week.	6945.92919921875
"i wish i could say any thing to comfort you," replied elizabeth; "but
it is wholly out of my power.	4345.85546875
"i am by no means of opinion, i assure you," said he, "that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself
that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins
in the course of the evening, and i take this opportunity of soliciting
yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."	5456.73388671875
"it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason.	4838.7109375
when tea was over, mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.	4569.8369140625
"i am grieved, indeed," cried darcy; "grieved--shocked.	5782.3544921875
a house in town!	4652.7216796875
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	4586.12158203125
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenelworth, birmingham, &c. are
sufficiently known.	4798.15380859375
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.	4329.25927734375
his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in
spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.	4194.41357421875
their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like
man--he is a great friend of darcy's."	5160.25537109375
every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes
upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.	5549.5458984375
on miss lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "very well; if it must be so, it must."	6690.20751953125
there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well.	4586.52392578125
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her.	4663.3251953125
"and _that_ i suppose is one of your sisters."	4628.52197265625
"not at all.	4543.64111328125
as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."	4629.8466796875
i will go directly to mr. bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure."	4011.826171875
the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street.	4770.6904296875
on this point she was
soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they
parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of
jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that
might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	4720.099609375
her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more,
and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"there are very few people of whom so much can be said.	3636.37939453125
jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	5221.01318359375
where shall you change
horses?--oh!	4081.977294921875
but, lizzy!	3777.786865234375
the fee is
     owed to the owner of the project gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     project gutenberg literary archive foundation.	4355.47314453125
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	4167.01513671875
are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?"	4687.24169921875
"heaven forbid!--_that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--to
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--do not wish me
such an evil."	3636.962158203125
chapter vi.	4350.4873046875
"come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	4613.92578125
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	4647.3203125
your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, i am sure.	4398.05615234375
stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."	5795.26171875
chapter xxi.	6027.56103515625
in
understanding darcy was the superior.	4916.892578125
do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."	4375.64453125
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley's being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.	6632.1259765625
"you may depend on it," replied the other, "for mrs. nicholls was in
meryton last night; i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	4646.03076171875
"oh!	6136.18310546875
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated
elopement.	4092.841064453125
but do you think she
would be prevailed on to go back with us?	5231.67431640625
good or bad?"	4411.54052734375
remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something
like regard and esteem for our cousin."	5502.9833984375
the promised
letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	5024.5341796875
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	4882.7158203125
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.	5216.5537109375
my dear lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"	3967.13720703125
"because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	5848.66796875
his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.	4662.15576171875
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.	5358.7236328125
your
     father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as i said before, they
     had a great deal of talk together.	4010.8583984375
"did not you?	4853.52783203125
"i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said darcy.	4673.2177734375
i
     thank you, again and again, for not going to the lakes.	4174.43310546875
as no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all mr. collins's scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.	3974.946044921875
she saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it."	3960.8994140625
they are in the same profession, you know; only in different
lines.	4721.3330078125
his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!	5848.3837890625
bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	5181.5634765625
as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,

"i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.	3912.26806640625
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party.--"i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly," said lady catherine; "i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do.	5226.8671875
"how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet!	4253.30078125
bingley met them with hopes
that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.	4904.84228515625

and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia's relations, for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable
amount.	5437.119140625

"do you certainly leave kent on saturday?"	4257.7041015625
he was writing, and, without raising his head,
coolly replied,

"just as you please."	5200.10791015625
"i think you said she was a widow, sir?	4429.94287109375
putting
away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,

"i did not know before that you ever walked this way."	4411.4267578125
affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every
where.	5279.6357421875
what will you think of my vanity?	4942.919921875
"yes," replied wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	4845.998046875

he had been some time with mr. gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning.	4776.99609375
he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.	5827.47802734375
"and this is always the way with him," she added.--"whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	3907.193359375
london:

military library, whitehall.	5026.7197265625
"what can be the meaning of this!"	4349.50439453125
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library,

"oh!	1628.1485595703125
why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"	4445.10205078125
she was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought mr.
wickham immediately to elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the
day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had
represented.	4194.41357421875
it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be of
short duration.	5265.54638671875
"but the wife of mr.
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."	4249.46923828125
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every
body."	4262.595703125
this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	4428.439453125
i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
     something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock
     is over, shall i own that i long for your return?	4509.2197265625
in the hall they parted.	4029.04931640625
"then, who taught you?	4237.595703125
the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr. darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they
had known any thing of the matter.	4054.58984375
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done, to give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room, when last at pemberley.	4529.89111328125
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday.	4833.8447265625
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"	4947.9853515625
the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	4498.22412109375
elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,

"you mean to frighten me, mr. darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me?	4926.54296875
"but you--how are you?"	5359.1787109375
when i last saw her, she was not very promising.	4903.88330078125
the
rector of a parish has much to do.--in the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.	4835.154296875
"she is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."	5588.8486328125
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.	4489.18603515625

in every thing else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived.	5073.97802734375
excuse me--for i must speak plainly.	4540.830078125
it originated in
mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's.	4623.5322265625
he has been accused of many
     faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	5843.14892578125
at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant i can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but
for your sakes, we would do any thing.	6335.99755859375
no."	4368.96044921875
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	4357.31787109375
"oh!	5217.99169921875
in that case he would return no more.	4693.7412109375
my
father, however, is partial to mr. wickham.	5032.35107421875
she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.	4522.98876953125
not a soul knew of it, but col. and mrs.
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!	4458.85400390625
"go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the
different walks.	5855.5947265625
the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.	5878.6298828125
her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	4746.45703125
the first mentioned
     was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached
     mr. bingley from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in
     defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,
     ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of mr.	4503.14306640625
i dearly love a
laugh."	5083.85400390625
his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	3998.556884765625
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucas's last week; and even mr. darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least.	4376.2080078125
wickham of course wanted more
     than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	4178.7109375
it was at sir william lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.	4370.78564453125
in this danger kitty
is also comprehended.	6435.13671875
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him.	5391.0732421875
his principal object must be, to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham.	4724.0087890625
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information.	4039.298583984375
chapter viii.	4165.93798828125
you must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much."	4764.08447265625
"i desire you will do no such thing.	4194.41357421875
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
enquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.	4879.8203125
if he had been so very
agreeable he would have talked to mrs. long.	5276.69091796875
"you have said quite enough, madam.	4865.7255859375
"i believe her to be both in a great degree," replied wickham; "i have
not seen her for many years, but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	5095.4208984375
i hope she will turn out well."	5356.1484375
seriously, i would have you be on your guard.	4701.056640625
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was.	4421.1474609375
elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit
her, the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.	3937.40966796875
he added, that mr.
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon.	4548.15869140625
she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.	4831.22705078125
it will pass away soon enough."	5314.80126953125
only look at her.	5031.56884765625
she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.	4654.23046875
she will
make him a very proper wife."	4478.46142578125
chapter xxii.	4363.0185546875
let wickham
be _your_ man.	3867.3818359375
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection."	3812.18701171875
in
a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be
nothing more to plague her on his account.	5459.21142578125
a great deal more passed at the
other table.	5024.7978515625
miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present.	4795.61474609375
cried mrs. gardiner.	4584.24560546875
"you are joking, lizzy.	4170.7998046875
poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me.	4328.9375
"i have said no such thing.	4183.53564453125
miss bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	4536.51025390625
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr. collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	5014.208984375
he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	5184.4453125
"lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."	4953.38671875
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	4391.1201171875
"oh!	4960.6669921875
"this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."	3718.022705078125
but i
will not repine.	4139.54248046875
i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older."	5166.6669921875
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.	4447.87109375
to
put me on my guard?	4697.51611328125
lady catherine seemed resigned.	4626.80517578125
"she is so fond of mrs. forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away!	4594.07080078125
"i have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.	4776.28515625
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy
had been over-rated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner's
long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

     "i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have
     done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but
     to say the truth, i was too cross to write.	4941.2138671875
"pray tell your sister that i long to see her."	4897.443359375
do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will.	5979.71337890625
as
for mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth
with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at
table,

"this is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	3763.20947265625
her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to
speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia's
situation, hastily exclaimed, "i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.	4573.99609375
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness.	4365.82421875
what
     he means to do, i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress
     will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest
     way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again
     to-morrow evening.	4691.78076171875
their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	3265.080322265625
"no, i should have turned in a moment."	4273.6591796875
and this consideration leads me moreover to
     reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last
     november, for had it been otherwise, i must have been involved in
     all your sorrow and disgrace.	4867.12744140625
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable.	4958.08447265625
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself.	5434.2470703125
he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
     and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would
     present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there
     could be little doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other
     person to provide for, and i could not have forgotten my revered
     father's intentions.	4528.47900390625
"and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?"	4836.8974609375
to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr. bingley's heart were entertained.	5514.7939453125
it drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present.	4424.2431640625
her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.	4269.41455078125
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will
prove what she felt.	4771.1044921875
miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	4498.92333984375
but, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	5499.048828125
you know pretty well, i suppose,
     what has been done for the young people.	4695.12451171875
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	4194.41357421875
"i never heard that it was."	5505.4248046875
cried elizabeth, when she had finished.	4297.3759765625
i will put on my things in a moment.	4503.5810546875
but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr. darcy's
pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr. denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,

"i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."	4593.62841796875
he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	3526.655029296875
however, i did not hear above one word in ten,
for i was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham.	4970.5927734375
"i should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	5258.029296875
"how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say.--_you_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."	5033.18115234375
the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	5963.18115234375
it may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.	4442.95751953125
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	5066.3671875
you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it.	4285.28662109375
i dare say i shall
soon see them here."	4365.01220703125
she was ashamed to think how
much.	4229.1455078125
i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	4677.5869140625
"not at all."	5788.9697265625
come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia's folly."	5056.4765625
the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	4572.58740234375
as for myself, it is many, many years since i first began to think
     of him in a very different manner.	4903.8271484375
i am very glad
you liked her.	5026.27392578125
whenever charlotte came to see
them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as mr. bennet were dead.	5416.50537109375
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.	4977.7177734375
mamma would like to
go too of all things!	4062.625
"you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir."	4259.8525390625
you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	4043.862060546875
her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea, and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.	5419.27490234375
mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger than
mrs. bennet and mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces.	4710.91650390625
and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs. long.	4719.744140625
"and do you really know all this?"	4948.2451171875
"oh!	5162.69189453125
kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do.	4778.12109375
"la!	4424.51318359375
it must be an amusing study."	4696.13671875
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
little disposed to approve them.	4781.97802734375
this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled."	4056.809814453125
vol.	4708.02880859375
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very
often.	4082.125244140625
kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.	3844.4541015625
was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	4863.16015625
dear, dear lizzy.	4547.8720703125
"well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them.	4495.9814453125
when she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	4420.2412109375
do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified.	4629.3828125
i speak nothing but the truth.	5067.72509765625
they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had
been in the way of procuring.	6392.0341796875
mr. gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday.	4475.28076171875
he knows where we live.	4861.1435546875
"i have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	4889.18798828125
i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned."	4951.8564453125
she saw her in idea settled in
that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters.	4447.28125
you will not, i hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	4457.982421875
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	4786.96044921875
they are all for what they can get.	5318.50244140625
it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	5000.4990234375
he confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
     ill-consequences of lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	4114.69091796875
"mr. darcy is all politeness," said elizabeth, smiling.	5129.359375
"certainly, sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world.--every savage can
dance."	4968.7255859375
as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents.	4206.8486328125
his character sunk on every
review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.
darcy's sister, as, by wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.	6441.916015625
from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.--your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry mr. collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_."	5313.580078125
you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did.	5275.0458984375
and so, is it quite certain he is coming?"	5434.5009765625
why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?"	1347.2889404296875
be assured, my dear sir, that mrs. collins and
     myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	4461.12939453125
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	4844.09423828125
i
did not expect such a compliment."	4478.39306640625
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.	4563.06494140625
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.	4783.9072265625
smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.	4736.4140625
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs. bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.	4993.474609375
"when i wrote that letter," replied darcy, "i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."	5561.9443359375
"that is the most unforgiving speech," said elizabeth, "that i ever
heard you utter.	4209.810546875
they were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.	4370.55224609375
"i am exceedingly gratified," said bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	4806.603515625
this must be the grossest falsehood!"	5918.462890625
vol.	4613.51220703125
"your first position is false.	4738.072265625
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.	6567.89990234375
you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	3904.459228515625
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was mrs. hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.	5136.66796875
"only think of its being three months," she cried, "since i went away;
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time.	4801.6923828125
yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of."	4400.76220703125
your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	6645.26318359375
"my uncle is to send a servant for us."	4691.33349609375
"perhaps that is not possible for any one.	5228.3525390625
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine.	4062.81103515625
we neither of us perform to strangers."	5938.54541015625
where is your sash my dear?"	6084.85546875
it was to this effect:

     "since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of
     a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming
     you--be assured that we are all well.	5371.796875
mr.	4159.6259765625
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light.	4897.97119140625
"and quite alone?	6088.8486328125
chapter xii.	5436.63671875
"she did indeed, louisa.	4836.9345703125
"you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	5756.263671875
collins."	5094.021484375
"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before.	4511.57666015625
it was over at last however.	4839.70751953125
"would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!"	5509.7841796875
the family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive
them.	4392.78271484375
yes--i understand you perfectly."	4578.87548828125
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr. darcy's proposals.	4803.8173828125
mr. darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	4726.275390625
elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express.	4514.62841796875
his circumstances, he
     assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it, were
     exceedingly bad.	5033.958984375
the park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed
one of the gates into the ground.	4488.39404296875
one must speak a little, you know.	4702.2626953125
"i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"	4344.6083984375
but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley's chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs."	4594.8681640625
as he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of
a favourable answer.	7172.04345703125
"and pray
may i ask?"	4382.47265625
but he is a
liberal master, i suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant
comprehends every virtue."	5832.82666015625
she shook her head.	4958.935546875
elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph.	4271.50341796875
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	4674.0869140625
"true.	4343.5146484375
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs. gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent.	4756.5439453125
he does not
want abilities.	4603.35986328125
"perhaps we might be deceived."	5363.990234375
how can they suit each other?--do you
know mr.	4194.41357421875
"how could
you begin?"	5063.9228515625
how is half such a sum to be
repaid?"	4841.79443359375
if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	4057.076904296875
mr. collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	5072.2265625
she cried.	4749.67626953125
"tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"	4151.13330078125
bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern, at having been prevented by business.	4194.41357421875
let us hope for
better things.	5999.025390625
"good heaven!	4626.07275390625
at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband.	6345.71533203125
charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	4449.033203125
her report was highly favourable.	4430.1416015625
yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	4952.45166015625
elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, "what is the matter mamma?	4949.21728515625
but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."	4375.306640625
miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the piano-forte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.	4409.78662109375
it was agreed to.	4254.21337890625
--and
upon elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, "lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr.	4205.2919921875
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.	4079.280517578125
"i admire the activity of your benevolence," observed mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."	4300.22509765625
my uncle!"	6985.99462890625
it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr. collins's wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.	4001.211669921875
have you had any
flirting?	4469.69775390625
mrs. bennet's best
comfort was, that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.	5018.64404296875
"the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"	5293.74267578125
he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing,
that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere.	4813.6220703125
"now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy.	5244.65283203125
well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."	4268.67724609375
and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.	4913.27880859375
such a
change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such
its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means
unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	4436.84326171875
i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."	4720.9189453125
jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected.	5702.15625
"oh!	4164.4208984375
most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.	3445.794921875
elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her.	5112.5400390625
she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet, and was a
great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	5206.0322265625
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	4687.013671875
i do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, jane--one does not often see any body
better looking.	5894.8212890625
the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.	4251.66259765625
"oh!	5852.5966796875
unfeeling, selfish girl!	5676.134765625
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr. collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings.	4314.9853515625
chapter xxiii.	4998.41064453125
"i say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows
him," replied the other.	4800.0712890625
for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse."	4647.0810546875
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	5060.244140625
she dared not
even mention that gentleman.	4797.0146484375
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time,
for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once.	4692.51904296875
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited.	4938.3544921875
darcy said very
little, and mr. hurst nothing at all.	4834.69775390625
he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.	4586.61572265625
"is this a hint to me, lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"	5956.17333984375
and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report?	5461.4609375
"what should not you mind?"	4807.712890625
"i am," said he, with a firm voice.	4938.70751953125
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs. hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london.	4987.43505859375
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	3831.719970703125
the first week of their return was soon gone.	4448.95263671875
the idea of mr. collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued:

"my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.	4769.5986328125
had the late mr. darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me, irritated him i believe very early in life.	4300.93896484375
elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	4880.66748046875
in
truth i must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble
parsonage, i should not think any one abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings."	6174.90966796875
"it was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	4490.76171875
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?"	4671.9208984375
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)	5360.103515625
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	5233.091796875
"yes, almost every day."	4895.54248046875
my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.	5015.68701171875
but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.	4409.63916015625
but she would not be secure.	6784.07568359375
mrs. bennet could hardly
contain herself.	5926.27392578125
the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.	4976.74462890625
u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.	4626.58935546875
her curiosity however was unexpectedly
relieved.	5302.16015625
i guessed as much."	5188.837890625
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton.	4187.56298828125
"i know not, miss elizabeth," said he, "whether mrs. collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.	5020.05126953125
"you are then resolved to have him?"	4927.5576171875
"you have a very small park here," returned lady catherine after a short
silence.	4477.31298828125
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.	3556.42724609375
"the garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship's residence."	5007.7578125
"is this," thought elizabeth, "meant for me?"	5022.63232421875
"i have no right to give _my_ opinion," said wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.	4818.4541015625
"a great deal of good management, depend upon it.	4793.712890625
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	4388.84228515625
i expected
you to stay two months.	3960.17041015625
elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "oh!	4482.55517578125
there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.	5603.3544921875
mrs. long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not.	4822.99609375
mr. bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, &c. mrs. bennet was quite
disconcerted.	5034.22802734375
her colour
changed, and she said no more.	4194.5576171875
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner, whenever they did.	4902.8359375
she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr. darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	5259.142578125
but however he did not.	4579.2119140625
nothing could
console and nothing appease her.--nor did that day wear out her
resentment.	4649.47900390625
they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	4891.0908203125
one day's delay she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite
so obstinate as usual.	4402.4287109375
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would
be necessary to clear his expences at brighton.	4505.87109375
"you have a house in town, i conclude?"	4259.4951171875
"you need not distress yourself.	4364.8623046875
mamma, do the
people here abouts know i am married to-day?	4194.41357421875
"he has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."	5506.95263671875
but your
_family_ owe me nothing.	5761.3544921875
said miss bingley; "will
she be as tall as i am?"	4854.5556640625
she has been doing
every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?	3576.10595703125
yes.	4998.482421875
she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success.	4277.03515625
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.	4461.36328125
there was neither in figure nor face, any
likeness between the ladies.	4790.0703125
he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.	4882.0546875
elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect.	4633.419921875
but is it
certain, absolutely certain?"	4501.146484375
when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn, as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	4706.287109375
i assure you, that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it."	5618.4443359375
let me hear
     from you very soon.	4631.29052734375
"had you then persuaded yourself that i should?"	4490.45361328125
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.	4204.85888671875
you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say.	5796.95849609375
"could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his
wife?"	4335.2421875
mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	5483.9609375
she was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being mr.
darcy, she was directly retreating.	6101.712890625
they were hopeless of remedy.	4361.60009765625
it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	5555.201171875
"and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"	4984.12109375
they have at
least that advantage."	6184.716796875
i knew it myself, as
     it was known to miss bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant
     of it.--that they might have met without ill consequence, is
     perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough
     extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--perhaps this
     concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--it is done, however,
     and it was done for the best.--on this subject i have nothing more
     to say, no other apology to offer.	4930.6650390625
kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	4756.2578125
she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs.
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy.	4664.74853515625
"your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you.	5563.333984375
and poor mr. darcy!	4837.6728515625
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	4653.28076171875
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her, was still more strange.	4943.146484375
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned.	6766.30078125
and when i returned home, the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	4814.765625
"oh!	4117.83544921875
if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him.	5327.15771484375
"miss elizabeth bennet!"	4010.09716796875
well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.	4479.2900390625
"i have, sir."	3421.223388671875
however, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a project gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"plain vanilla ascii" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official project gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "plain vanilla ascii" or other
form.	4944.11767578125
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london, at the same time that mr. bennet
came from it.	6017.3779296875
she was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.	4405.8056640625
"oh, lizzy!	4788.55419921875
at least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."	4381.9833984375
"you write uncommonly fast."	5316.02783203125
yes, i call it a _very_ easy distance."	4156.85791015625
he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."	4327.70751953125
everything wore
a happier aspect.	4553.8095703125
"i do not know.--i hope there was.--but to be guarded at such a time, is
very difficult.	5071.9072265625
he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr. darcy.	5698.04638671875
he was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any
one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and
he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his
assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	4073.36376953125
"ah!"	3955.441162109375
could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster?	4639.39794921875
to all the
objections i have already urged, i have still another to add.	5325.0244140625
it is admirable!"	4725.076171875
"his father was an excellent man," said mrs. gardiner.	5135.84521484375
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	4476.98388671875
elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	4518.0439453125
"and my mother--how is she?	4534.0751953125
"were it certain that lady catherine would think so," said mr. collins
very gravely--"but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.	4643.71826171875
colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.	4474.619140625
he had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.	5090.767578125
his surprise was great.	4463.50390625
the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	3864.837890625
"you used us abominably ill," answered mrs. hurst, "in running away
without telling us that you were coming out."	4733.18115234375
in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!	5342.6240234375
"what could he mean?	4598.67333984375
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day
     after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting
     for them.	4880.32275390625
"remember, eliza, that he does not know jane's disposition as you do."	5420.8408203125
having said thus much, i feel no
     doubt of your secrecy.	4895.77587890625
when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.	5521.29296875
she was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when.	5783.837890625
darcy.--_i_ talked about
the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
the room, or the number of couples."	4300.91015625
"he must be an oddity, i think," said she.	5521.7666015625
here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	4013.1923828125
"yes, or i will never see her again."	4120.78564453125
"i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."	5533.28515625
after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley's voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
enquiry after the health of her family.	4444.326171875
"if one could but go to brighton!"	4552.7890625
i am the happiest creature in
     the world.	5547.572265625
at present i am not in love with
mr. wickham; no, i certainly am not.	6054.41943359375
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham's removal
from the ----shire, as clearly as mr. gardiner could do.	5253.4482421875
in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great.	4910.55224609375
"yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	3857.061279296875
"what do you mean, mr. bennet, by talking in this way?	5129.4765625
lydia came to
     us; and wickham had constant admission to the house.	4619.21337890625
indeed, mr. darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	5527.056640625
her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	4473.85107421875
bromley, of course.--if you mention my name at the bell,
you will be attended to."	5158.5283203125
i send no compliments to your
mother.	4771.30908203125
*       *       *       *       *

in the evening, soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr. darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme.	4230.39599609375
"she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."	4433.734375
but on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her.	4943.1513671875
if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should
     be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.	5093.34130859375
i always said it must be so, at last.	4509.27978515625
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.	4671.67578125
i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_, that miss elizabeth bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, mr. darcy.	4847.07958984375
darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented.	5801.34423828125
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply.	5173.9990234375
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	5128.078125
"and of your infliction," cried elizabeth with energy.	5788.8818359375
i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together.	4574.0615234375
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name.	4585.68408203125
elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.	5182.5419921875
i shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	5611.568359375
dear lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered.	4509.5849609375
"i like her appearance," said elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	4481.1533203125
darcy!"	4589.63037109375
"what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him?	4194.41357421875
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	4730.34716796875
"and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself?	4831.978515625
"it is well.	5079.2939453125
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head.	4453.36328125
you must not suspect me.	5381.693359375
i must confess myself
     surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.	4962.9052734375
how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a
like manner.	4594.3076171875
"i think i have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton."	3702.175048828125
you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	4710.1796875
this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place.	4498.5205078125
i know not in what manner, under what form of
     falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to
     be wondered at.	4375.66943359375
the
latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	4237.9228515625
i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing.	4295.9375
"they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."	4913.01611328125
--

"my dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	4431.27392578125
"there is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he
is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him."	4576.79736328125
"and men take care that they should."	4607.83544921875
when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her
in return, by sitting down to whist.	4398.03515625
i
     must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
     myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce
     me to unfold to any human being.	4947.69287109375
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of mrs.
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.	4474.341796875
yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well, and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again.	5217.931640625
elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	5029.2373046875
"how could i ever think her like her nephew?"	4935.298828125
no look appeared
on either side that spoke particular regard.	3814.3798828125
she smiled, but made no answer.	4872.0361328125
i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.	4103.70263671875
not these two or three years perhaps."	7260.75927734375
oh!	4573.5380859375
it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of
her attachment to mr. darcy.	3802.6845703125

bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.	4672.24169921875
the carriage was sent to meet
them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	4959.294921875
kitty, run down and order the carriage.	3783.844482421875
mr. gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	5492.42431640625
"oh!	6617.197265625
darcy took up a book; miss bingley did the same;
and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with miss
bennet.	4448.99951171875
she enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	4461.05712890625
"and this is your real opinion!	5241.67236328125
it was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of her's.	5287.869140625
a carat character is used to denote superscription.	5657.9755859375
i never saw such a long chin in my life.	4372.42431640625
"his being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment."	4069.9775390625
it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."	4536.328125
well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next?	5171.87744140625
elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest down stairs.	4092.208984375
"my father is gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour.	5567.16064453125
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two,
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time.	4918.796875
"well, so much the better.	5060.39404296875
with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"	6593.26025390625
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.	4602.10009765625
this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married.	4455.474609375
"in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure," said bingley; "and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."	4440.22509765625
they talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every
thing but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner
thought of him, and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by
her niece's beginning the subject.	5205.1884765625
no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room.	5014.3955078125
if there
were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining
such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	5098.15234375
the path just admitted three.	4819.189453125
mr. gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	4598.35791015625
that he should have been in love with her for
so many months!	5656.82666015625
"oh, jane,
take care."	5108.95751953125
i have not been accustomed to such
language as this.	4726.833984375
"as much as i ever wish to be," cried elizabeth warmly,--"i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable."	4455.48291015625
chapter xiii.	4702.03857421875
she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.	4788.9423828125
she got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour.	4382.61474609375
had i but explained some part of it only--some part of what
i learnt, to my own family!	5098.240234375
"aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.	5016.3232421875
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on.	4231.21142578125
but, however, he is very welcome to
come to netherfield, if he likes it.	6945.92919921875
mr.
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	4194.41357421875
it is highly improper.	4994.53173828125
elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.	4350.03125
if i had ever learnt, i
should have been a great proficient.	4439.306640625
make haste, make haste.	4957.2099609375
mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.	4180.955078125
i shall never forget her appearance this morning.	4570.751953125
to persuade him against
     returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
     was scarcely the work of a moment.--i cannot blame myself for
     having done thus much.	4035.1826171875
"very, very much.	4318.3525390625
lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her.	5356.8076171875
there is
one point, on which i want your advice.	4203.90869140625
"nothing is more deceitful," said darcy, "than the appearance of
humility.	5411.0224609375
"and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry?	5817.9990234375
"i beg your pardon," replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.	3907.94970703125
"mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	4415.26123046875
what a contrast between him and his friend!	4591.15380859375
"but," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."	4994.72265625
soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately.	4748.91552734375
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	5327.13720703125

"i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."	4681.34912109375
but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much.	5267.333984375
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	4016.680419921875
i have not _that_ pain.	4944.740234375
if your
feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once.	4338.24462890625
"do you prefer reading to cards?"	5035.47607421875
mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.	5427.193359375
i will take care of
myself, and of mr. wickham too.	4809.1669921875
"oh!"	4990.7275390625
it
was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	3744.811279296875
but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance."	4789.8330078125

how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so
desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for
happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own
family!	4699.12451171875
well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr.	4537.29296875
chapter vi.	5669.8642578125
"oh!	4194.41357421875
something he supposed might be attributed
to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his life.	4270.896484375
not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,

"jane, i congratulate you.	4734.025390625
what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr. bingley--is not he?	5244.94287109375
my sweetest lizzy!	5190.4560546875
"yes, all of them, i think.	6043.4765625
said elizabeth, "but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with."	4865.22021484375
"i do not believe a word of it, my dear.	3929.21728515625
iii.	6114.4404296875
i roused, and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_.	5885.1201171875
it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.	5258.9267578125
"my dear eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have
called on us in this familiar way."	4934.2353515625
we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.	5073.048828125
is she handsome?"	4216.3193359375
he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london."	4193.44189453125
"but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so
soon after this event."	4379.67333984375
it gives me pain
to speak ill of a darcy.	4957.498046875
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.	4945.3955078125
chapter xvii.	4818.47705078125
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.	5197.86181640625
but in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair.	4551.23046875
"as often as i can.	3676.76416015625
miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.	4566.4951171875
cried lydia.	4961.9775390625
such a charming man!--so handsome!	4789.7783203125
oh, lizzy!	5032.06298828125
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence--elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough.	4692.28662109375
a few weeks, he believed.	3627.028076171875
_i_ did for you.	4418.310546875
but mr. bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	4951.58251953125
he danced
only four dances!	3545.06640625
"if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside," cried bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."	5924.6806640625
on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.	4803.5654296875
the next was in these words.	4826.1845703125
but here he was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured
him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	4631.02099609375
with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted!	5227.8935546875
"oh!	4389.15625
her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	4484.45361328125

long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.	4166.140625
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way.	6318.31201171875
"you have.	4353.126953125
to be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."	5118.37451171875
he had not
a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of
preference which was often given me."	4177.59521484375
their fortune on both
sides is splendid.	4213.15185546875
how you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"	5168.9384765625
and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,

"dear ma'am, do not go.--i beg you will not go.--mr.	4491.64404296875
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	5011.9287109375
1.d.	4710.1572265625
"i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."	4495.09814453125
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
     much, and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help.	4481.05908203125
"come, darcy," said he, "i must have you dance.	4292.18212890625
she had known, it seems,
of their being in love with each other, many weeks."	5747.70068359375
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	6207.6025390625
i must conclude, for i cannot be
     long from my poor mother.	4830.1904296875
_i_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."	5023.98828125
she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "this must be false!	3600.800537109375
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were
     all gone to bed, from colonel forster, to inform us that she was
     gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth,
     with wickham!--imagine our surprise.	4627.98828125
an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.	4384.265625
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	4824.0263671875
reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk,
in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.	4867.13671875
"she is a very good kind of girl, i believe.	4279.49560546875
a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little.	5032.00048828125
she wrote even
to jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard.	4624.0927734375
_you_ cannot have
been always at longbourn."	5662.69384765625
i am not equal to it.	4915.42041015625
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.--mr.	4194.41357421875
if, indeed, it should be so!	4459.49169921875
human nature is so prone to
fall into it!	4363.318359375
collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
ceased speaking, replied thus,

"my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.	4314.49169921875
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.	4387.2939453125
she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!--what do you think has happened this morning?--mr.	4852.58349609375
she read over her aunt's commendation of him
again and again.	5154.6337890625
"i do not recollect that we did."	4551.36083984375
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been
heard of the fugitives.	5158.3759765625
to these high
flown expressions, elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	4159.09423828125
the tumult of elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	4387.63720703125
her ease and good
spirits increased.	4284.6611328125
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was
therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to
hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to
be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy.	4038.566650390625
it was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.	5413.4482421875
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their
aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was
well talked over.--to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	3628.46044921875
oh!	4066.08642578125
do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.	5638.72900390625
i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally
     to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are
     packed up.	4483.13232421875
he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	4655.2646484375
but i confess they would have no charms
for _me_.	4596.9326171875
well, and so just
as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business
to that horrid man mr. stone.	4602.771484375
it was first broken by mrs. annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs. gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	5596.25146484375
bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them.	4639.2431640625
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by
character perfectly well.	4870.2705078125
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw.	6265.783203125
chapter ii.	4760.296875
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ("the foundation"
or pglaf), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project
gutenberg-tm electronic works.	3681.52880859375
"_i_ never saw such a woman.	5003.2373046875
he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	4771.2412109375
a scheme of which every part promises delight, can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."	5783.6337890625
he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, i am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."	5028.1435546875
"on the evening before my going to london," said he "i made a confession
to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago.	4979.56494140625
i
never was.	4669.8896484375
yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember."	4676.64599609375
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states.	5199.59716796875
"with three younger sisters grown up," replied elizabeth smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	4907.59814453125
mr. bennet treated the matter differently.	4790.111328125
when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	4702.04736328125
"oh!	4194.41357421875
the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	5699.34521484375
"if we thought alike of miss bingley," replied jane, "your
representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	4540.431640625
till this moment, i never knew myself."	4455.24072265625
if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough.	4486.6865234375
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought
only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin.	5859.4267578125
what shall we do with him?	4841.8310546875
they had frequently been staying with her in town.	4638.75634765625
such very
superior dancing is not often seen.	5414.37744140625
mr. wickham is the son of a very
     respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the
     pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his
     trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on
     george wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore
     liberally bestowed.	4707.84912109375
i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield.	4442.19921875
miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.	4396.1357421875
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,

"miss bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master.	4746.71044921875
"my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?"	4759.3251953125
there is nothing else to be done.	4604.7998046875
the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr. wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	4415.3623046875
"already arisen!"	4843.22607421875
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and i am sure i
never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."	4833.4208984375
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions.	4604.0361328125
women fancy admiration means more than
it does."	4473.06201171875
i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance.	4418.55517578125
the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more i think than last year.	4925.2978515625
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.	4801.1015625
in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him.	5285.42919921875
"how can you contrive to write so even?"	4090.679443359375
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister, "ah!	4011.891357421875
"well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	3664.51904296875
"a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."	3992.30029296875
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!"	4298.1298828125
thought elizabeth.	5389.44873046875
"i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."	4833.79443359375
i told him of
all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,
absurd and impertinent.	4736.5361328125
but,
my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."	4002.830078125
but his pride, his abominable pride, his
shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane, his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr. wickham, his
cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the
pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	4449.06298828125
it must be his own doing.--he is his own master.	4602.5478515625
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage."	5976.44091796875
"_that_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_."	4738.52392578125
my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last.	4578.42578125
"oh!	4087.933837890625
mr. darcy felt their rudeness
and immediately said,--

"this walk is not wide enough for our party.	5535.3642578125
so much the better.	4978.548828125
"i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."	4727.857421875
"what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	3935.438720703125
but my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards miss king.	5032.3701171875
"yes, she called yesterday with her father.	4453.4990234375

my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking.	5629.1650390625
they could
not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known,
would not have recognised it for mr. darcy.	5265.41552734375
you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him."	5338.142578125
"and that," said mrs. reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him.	4417.5859375
he takes them now for people of
fashion."	3731.4072265625
"laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.	4180.9033203125
a low phaeton, with a nice little
     pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	4300.5654296875
"now i am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	6003.36328125
let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor."	4467.17041015625
its completion depended on others.	6032.3056640625
he was resolutely silent however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,

"i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, '_she_
a beauty!--i should as soon call her mother a wit.'	5840.4638671875
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility.	4263.685546875

you must and shall be married by a special licence.	5015.8544921875
had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and
absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that
corps.	3709.083984375
"and of this place," thought she, "i might have been mistress!	5552.3837890625
the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.	4050.153076171875
"that is exactly what i should have supposed of you," said elizabeth.	4552.6240234375
he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure
_i_ never want to see him again.	5094.021484375
*       *       *       *       *

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition, which had appeased mrs. bennet's curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	4957.115234375
her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	4391.0654296875
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible.	5041.3623046875
she held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	4019.4970703125
when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen."	4542.3369140625
he still loves me, and we are
engaged."	4344.12744140625
"she seems a very pleasant young woman," said bingley.	5299.17236328125
she could
think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent.	4826.32763671875
he is gone to my father already.	4319.94677734375
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr. darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	5835.73681640625
my dear brother," replied mrs. bennet, "that is exactly what i
could most wish for.	4447.9853515625
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.	3966.89501953125
as a
child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
temper.	4304.59912109375
you shewed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."	5386.9873046875
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side.	5369.90185546875
it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	5907.849609375
"there can be no doubt of that.	4395.48974609375
"she will drop the acquaintance entirely."	4016.408447265625
i am
going away myself."	4224.19580078125
collins!"	4835.09423828125
but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	5410.88818359375
copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.	4978.62939453125
1.e.8.	4633.52587890625
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.	4634.31689453125
"i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation.	5210.900390625
as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery.	4890.208984375
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	4618.8564453125
my feelings will not be
repressed.	5340.525390625
"but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said jane.	5336.50341796875
i will speak to her about it myself directly.	5465.99951171875
"can you deny that you have done it?"	4513.560546875
"are you, indeed?	4664.73046875
"poor wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!	4917.7744140625
having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	4056.333984375
"most willingly."	4932.24072265625
your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make
_their_ marriage at all more probable?	5026.5087890625
"that is all very proper and civil, i am sure," said mrs. bennet, "and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	6976.93310546875
but, lizzy, this must go no farther
     than yourself, or jane at most.	4882.24072265625
"good heaven!	4817.31005859375
mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride.	5178.703125
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	5233.84521484375
it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.	5278.9658203125
in the absence of jane,
he always attached himself to elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.	3870.946533203125
"but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied darcy.	5161.96337890625
will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"	4055.223876953125
their powers of conversation were considerable.	7946.14404296875
mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--elizabeth was in agonies.	5034.90478515625
lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all!	3811.50732421875
and his sisters are charming women.	4374.10888671875
though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was."	4585.5224609375
he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	4780.591796875
i was afraid they might
not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle, so i was
determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and smiled like
any thing."	4668.9453125
the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.	4974.34375
he was a tall,
heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	4141.63134765625
it cannot be concealed from any one.	5511.560546875
elizabeth was surprised, but said
not a word.	4056.276123046875
_that_ is all to be forgot.	4291.51123046875
not a syllable was uttered by either; and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.	5019.07470703125
"indeed, mr. collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	4331.4521484375
that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr. darcy!	4948.12255859375
with assumed tranquillity he then replied, "i have no wish of denying
that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success.	4369.685546875
"to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."	4585.1767578125
it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills.	5107.9248046875
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton, these visitors came.	4606.412109375
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	4590.81689453125
he had been some days in town, before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us.	5495.3583984375
and then we were so merry all the way home!	4991.66064453125
miss lucas is married and settled.	4910.8798828125
for god's sake, say no more of
his partners.	4109.67529296875
mary," said she, "i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!	4373.19140625
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.	4442.15234375
perhaps he had been civil, only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease.	5389.474609375
the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.	4684.7705078125
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	4835.205078125
your idea of the ponies is delightful.	4581.49658203125
james's?"	6053.76123046875
were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me.	4592.45458984375
but it must not, shall not be.	4893.5634765625
and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.	4805.25634765625
elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	3956.18798828125
change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as
anything."	5151.01171875
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."	4215.94140625
your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentleman-like manner.'	4544.49072265625
within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.	4540.6044921875
they
are my old friends.	4857.46826171875
never, since reading jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of wickham's meaning to marry her.	5744.615234375
"my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."	4724.57177734375
i shall not go away, till you have given me the
assurance i require."	4755.21044921875
as long as she stays
there, it is all very well.	4068.87158203125
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.	4968.06201171875
darcy, after enquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	4678.9345703125
"but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
every thing will be well."	4360.27734375
they are gone down to
newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay, i do not know how long.	4825.001953125
"her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament.	5534.947265625
she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on.	4275.4609375
"perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	3736.76318359375
"i cannot make him
out.--there is something very pompous in his style.--and what can he
mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--we cannot suppose he
would help it, if he could.--can he be a sensible man, sir?"	6077.982421875
"mr. collins," said she, "speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
i suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."	4076.2666015625
though lydia's short
     letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to
     gretna green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief
     that w. never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which
     was repeated to colonel f. who instantly taking the alarm, set off
     from b. intending to trace their route.	4858.380859375
but, luckily, he came back
again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	5201.3232421875
his fear of her, has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart."	4865.8603515625
they then went away.	5690.51953125
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	5048.107421875
on the following monday, mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the christmas at
longbourn.	4403.68017578125
heaven forbid!	4562.869140625
i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	4703.9267578125
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	4690.5146484375
i _will_ leave him to himself."	5000.0791015625
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	4656.20166015625
_you_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	5412.35400390625
to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh?	5220.10205078125
younger sons cannot marry
where they like."	4839.97998046875
mrs. reynolds's respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.	4833.8681640625
"in point of composition," said mary, "his letter does not seem
defective.	4926.37353515625
i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.	4510.29052734375
but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good.	4864.1806640625
i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.	4422.0751953125
elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr. bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	4448.490234375
i am sure you must feel it
so."	4224.44140625
how can it affect them?"	5433.42333984375
the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	5169.421875
"they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine."	4637.3408203125
mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_you_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment.	3529.95263671875
the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.	5323.58740234375
the
adieu is charity itself.	6113.0009765625
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.	5446.2060546875
but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money.	4921.5791015625
i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a
     clergyman.	4625.10693359375
miss bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she
hoped that, by caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.	4838.29541015625
with _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!	4874.6015625
you must not disappoint your father."	4725.3330078125
who attended to you?	4070.6103515625
such a countenance, such manners!	5698.5029296875
the
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.	5067.16455078125
pray read on."	4797.78759765625
but no
such recollection befriended her.	3556.32568359375
"indeed i have, sir," was her answer.	5330.857421875
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	4324.5634765625
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing's park, when
he put his letter into her hand!	4627.67919921875
"well, lizzy," said mrs. bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane's?	5973.80810546875
collins must excuse
me.--he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	5813.92236328125
i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."	6215.6591796875
exclaimed elizabeth, "you are too good.	4967.28515625
