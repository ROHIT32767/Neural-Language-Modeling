     yourself and mrs. bennet, i am inclined to think that her own	1324.6466064453125

her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means	330.07904052734375

	1474.32666015625
wishes must still be unshaken. but she would not be secure.	1524.73583984375

silence. at length, she spoke again. "i have just had a letter from	325610.03125

being given on such a point, without being resented.	2822.9443359375
netherfield?--i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult	3961.326416015625
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her	1396.6134033203125
humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that	20289.1953125

never was. i ask only a comfortable home; and considering mr. collins's	1737.519287109375

"where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.	1558.381103515625
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round	490.7576904296875

"it taught me to hope," said he, "as i had scarcely ever allowed myself	1538.5018310546875
sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! a young man, such	137.76673889160156

could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight	100024.671875

civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.	586.8628540039062

miss bennet paused a little and then replied, "surely there can be no	2031.951904296875

not help saying,	2826.00146484375
something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had	573.72705078125

and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given	5076.06396484375
	516.62060546875
what they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again.	928.5062866210938

seemed a gulf impassable between them. had lydia's marriage been	756.4730224609375
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that	1196.258056640625

industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a	5732.099609375

mrs. gardiner's caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on	2470.35595703125

tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of such	952.49609375

smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its	2727.33935546875

darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth	2429.24951171875
three straws about her. who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled	754.355712890625

"very true, indeed;--and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in	13386.67578125
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without	5928.54638671875
it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."	919.752685546875
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the	820.5804443359375

was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of	725.2755737304688

and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and	7888.2099609375
rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various	575.693603515625
handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the	54162.29296875

reflections, "is a very common failing i believe. by all that i have	575.001708984375

considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."	11687.607421875
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	4123.20703125
	1666.443603515625
"what is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from	208.54534912109375
which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy's explanation	8172.9951171875

resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more	1926.5941162109375
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her	1685.961669921875
repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love	539.6708374023438

she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.	2015.89404296875
it seems but a fortnight i declare; and yet there have been things	27.463180541992188
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen	1048.4114990234375

uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by	280.7406005859375
sudden departure. an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.	986.6710205078125
agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure	3279.169677734375

in mud, i am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to	1047.041015625
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. it had given him a	1338.0235595703125

astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the	350.9396667480469
